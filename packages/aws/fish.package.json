To switch your current profile, just provide the profile name:\n\n```fish\n$ aws profile stage\n```\n\nYou can view your current profile by passing in no additional arguments:\n\n```fish\n$ aws profile\nstage\n```\n\nThe profiles available come from your AWS credentials file (`~/.aws/credentials`). Profile switching is very rudimentary and is just a shortcut for implicitly passing the `--profile \u003cname\u003e` option. If you need more robust AWS profile management, check out the [asp] plugin by [@mgoodness](https://github.com/mgoodness).\n\nYour current profile is saved between shell sessions.\n\n\n## License\n\n[MIT][mit] Â© [sagebind][author] et [al][contributors]\n\n\n[asp]: https://github.com/mgoodness/plugin-asp\n[author]: https://github.com/sagebind\n[aws-cli]: https://aws.amazon.com/cli/\n[contributors]: https://github.com/oh-my-fish/plugin-aws/graphs/contributors\n[license-badge]: https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-007EC7.svg?style=flat-square\n[mit]: https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT\n[omf]: https://github.com/oh-my-fish/oh-my-fish\n"}
