Similar to your favorite text editor!\n\n## Features\n\nHere `|` denotes the current cursor position. No manual cursor motion involved :sparkles:\n\n- autocloses pair symbol:\n  `... |` + \u003ckbd\u003e(\u003c/kbd\u003e ⇒\n  `...

This is specific to the way oh-my-fish handles installation.\n\n## Configuration\n\n### Only completing at the end of the line\n\nTo disable completing pairs unless the cursor is at the end of the line, set the `$pisces_only_insert_at_eol` variable:\n\n```fish\nset -U pisces_only_insert_at_eol 1\n```\n\n### Changing the set of pairs\n\nYou can set the `$pisces_pairs` universal variable and launch a new fish session to reload key bindings:\n\n```fish\nset -U pisces_pairs $pisces_pairs '\u003c,\u003e' '`,`' '«,»'\n```\n\nNote that at the moment _pisces_ works correctly only with single-symbol delimiters.\n\nThe default set of pairs:\n\n- `(,)` parenthesis\n- `[,]` brackets\n- `{,}` braces\n- `\",\"` double quotes\n- `','` single quotes\n"}
