It can be your `Documents`,\nit can be your home directory. Sometimes you have multiple directories,\nlike work, personal, college, etc.\n\nFinding a project is easy when you have a few projects and a central\ndirectory, but when any of projects or directories grows a lot, it gets\nreally difficult to find stuff you just wanted to work on.\n\nHere comes `prj`, a quick project jump tool based on a global path\nvariable: Project directories are present in `$project_path`.\n\nThis path variable can be enhanced the way you like with globbing tricks\nor even more complex setups that can be made on your init file.\n\n## So... How to?\n\n```fish\n$ omf install prj\n```\n\nUse `$OMF_CONFIG/before.init.fish` to setup your `$projects_path`:\n\n\u003e `$OMF_CONFIG/before.init.fish`\n```fish\nset -g $projects_path ~/workspace\n```\n\nYou can invoke `prj` to quickly jump to a best effort match:\n\n```fish\n/home/derek\u003e prj hello\n/home/derek/workspace/helloworld\u003e\n```\n\nCompletions are included, so you can always do a fish pager search.\n\nWhen multiple matches are found, `fzg` is invoked to choose the project.\n\n# License\n\n[MIT][mit] Â© [Derek Stavis][author] et [al][contributors]\n\n\n[mit]:            https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT\n[author]:         https://github.com/derekstavis\n[contributors]:   https://github.com/derekstavis/plugin-prj/graphs/contributors\n[omf-link]:       https://www.github.com/oh-my-fish/oh-my-fish\n\n[license-badge]:  https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-007EC7.svg?style=flat-square\n"}
