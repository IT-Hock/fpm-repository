Any arguments are passed directly to the ssh\ncommand.\n\n# License\n\n[MIT][mit] Â© [wk][author] et [al][contributors]\n\n\n[mit]:            http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT\n[author]:         http://github.com/wk\n[contributors]:   https://github.com/wk/pkg-ssh-term-helper/graphs/contributors\n[fish-link]:      https://fishshell.com/\n[omf-link]:       https://www.github.com/oh-my-fish/oh-my-fish\n[fisherman-link]: https://www.github.com/fisherman/fisherman\n\n[license-badge]:  https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-007EC7.svg?style=flat-square\n"}
