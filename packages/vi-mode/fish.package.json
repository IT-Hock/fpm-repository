If used, this function must be defined before\nloading `oh-my-fish`.\n\nExample:\n\n    function vi_mode_user_key_bindings\n        bind \\el  suppress-autosuggestion\n    end\n\n## Not implemented\n- bind 2 vi-arg-digit\n- bind y yank-direction\n- bind g magic :-P\n- bind ^a increment next number\n- bind ^x decrement next number\n- bind /?nN search (jk kind of does this)\n- registers (maybe try to make sensible integration into X, like an\n  explicit yank with y goes to an X selection, while an implicit\n  delete with x etc. doesn't. \"\\* and \"+ should natually go to the\n  appropriate X selection if possible)\n- etc.\n\n## Author\nThis mode has been created by [Ian Munsie][ian_github], the original file can\nbe found [here][original].\nIt has been adapted for oh-my-fish by [Sylvain Benner][syl_github].\n\n[ian_github]: https://github.com/DarkStarSword\n[original]: https://github.com/DarkStarSword/junk/blob/master/vi-mode.fish\n[syl_github]: https://github.com/syl20bnr\n\n\n\n"}
