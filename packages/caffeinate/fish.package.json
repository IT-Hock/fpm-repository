If unset the default is `git`.\n\n```fish\nset __caffeinate_include sleep \\\n                         git \\\n                         cap \\\n                         make\n```\n\nPlease note that this variable needs to be set before the plugin is loaded by\nOh My Fish, e.g. in `~/.config/fish/conf.d/` in a file that will be loaded\nbefore `omf.fish` in that same directory.\n\n# License\n\n[MIT][mit] © [Felix Schäfer][author] et [al][contributors]\n\n[mit]:            https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT\n[author]:         https://github.com/thegcat\n[contributors]:   https://github.com/thegcat/caffeinate/graphs/contributors\n[omf-link]:       https://www.github.com/oh-my-fish/oh-my-fish\n\n[license-badge]:  https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-007EC7.svg?style=flat-square\n"}
