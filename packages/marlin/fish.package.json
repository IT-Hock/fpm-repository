Marlin provides quick access to your most frequently and recently used directories from right in your [Fish] shell.\n\nMarlin is similar in design to popular scripts like [fasd], [z], and [autojump], but is designed to take advantage of the unique features of Fish to provide an even more powerful tool. It is also designed to have a simpler implementation to provide the best performance and not lag your shell.\n\nHere is a list of key features:\n\n- **Lightweight on resources**: Marlin only runs when you change directories or try to complete a path; it does not have pre-exec or post-exec hooks.\n- **Path expansion for any command**: Paths can be searched and expanded in any command, not just `cd`.\n- **Frequent and recent paths**: Results are ordered based on both the frequency you visit a directory and how recently you visited it.\n- **Interactive searching**: If more than one result matches an expansion, you can interactively choose a directory using an interactive filter tool like [fzf], [selecta], or [peco].\n\n## Install\nInstall with [Oh My Fish][omf]:\n\n```fish\n$ omf install marlin\n```\n\nThat's it, Marlin is ready to go!\n\n## Usage\nMarlin learns the directories you frequent while you navigate the filesystem. After `cd`ing around a few times, you can recall those directories using _comma expansion_, Marlin's way of substituting queries with a path. A comma expansion has the following form:\n\n    ,query1,query2,query3,...\n\nEach query is a case-insensitive regular expression that is applied to your directory history and filter only matching directories. To execute the expansion, just press the \u003ckbd\u003eTAB\u003c/kbd\u003e key and the query will be replaced dynamically with the matching result. You can continue to press \u003ckbd\u003eTAB\u003c/kbd\u003e to switch through all of the matching results in order of relevancy.\n\nIf you have an interactive filter tool installed like [fzf], [selecta], or [peco], you can use one of those tools to page through multiple results instead. The popular tools will be used automatically if installed. To use a specific tool, set the `$FILTER` environment variable to the command desired. You can also disable interactive filtering by setting `$FILTER` to be empty:\n\n```fish\nset -g FILTER\n```\n\n## Importing history\nYou can import your history from fasd by running the `marlin:import-fasd` command.\n\n## License\n[MIT][mit] Â© [sagebind][author] et [al][contributors]\n\n\n[author]: http://github.com/sagebind\n[autojump]: https://github.com/wting/autojump\n[contributors]: https://github.com/oh-my-fish/plugin-fasd/graphs/contributors\n[fasd]: https://github.com/clvv/\n[fish]: http://fishshell.com\n[fzf]: https://github.com/junegunn/fzf\n[mit]: http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT\n[omf]: https://www.github.com/oh-my-fish/oh-my-fish\n[peco]: https://github.com/peco/peco\n[selecta]: https://github.com/garybernhardt/selecta\n[z]: https://github.com/rupa/z\n"}
