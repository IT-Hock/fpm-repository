The string to digest can be provided either as an argument, or piped in from standard input:\n\n```fish\n# command line argument...\n$ hash md5 \"Hello World!\"\n# ...or piped\n$ cat myfile.txt | hash md5\n```\n\nThe available algorithms depend on what utilities you have installed on your system. If you have GNU coreutils installed, any of the algorithms that have an `\u003calgorithm\u003esum` command will be available. On BSD, the core digest commands provide the `md5`, `sha1`, `sha256`, `sha512`, and `rmd160` algorithms. Finally, if OpenSSL is installed, any algorithm installed for OpenSSL will also be available. To see if a given algorithm is available, you can run\n\n```fish\n$ hash -q \u003calgorithm\u003e\n```\n\n## License\n[MIT][mit] Â© [coderstephen][author] et [al][contributors]\n\n\n[mit]:            http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT\n[author]:         http://github.com/coderstephen\n[contributors]:   https://github.com/oh-my-fish/plugin-hash/graphs/contributors\n[omf]:            https://www.github.com/oh-my-fish/oh-my-fish\n[license-badge]:  https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-007EC7.svg?style=flat-square\n"}
