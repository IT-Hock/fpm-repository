It also provides a few helper functions.\n\n## Install\n\n```fish\n$ omf install asdf\n```\n\n\n## Usage\n\n```fish\n$ asdf \u003ccommand\u003e # see asdf documentation\n```\n\nHelper function for listing all installed asdf plugins with all their respective installed versions:\n\n```fish\n$ asdf-list-all\n```\n\nHelper functions for listing all active tools and their versions. This reads from `.tool-versions` files recursively up the directory tree starting from `pwd`. It also ignores global versions defined in `~/.tool-versions`.\n\n```fish\n$ asdf-tools\n```\n\n\n# TODO\n\nIn the future I plan to have this plugin provide fish functions for determining tool versions through asdf, so theme designers can optionally include tool versions in prompts.\n\n\n# License\n\n[MIT][mit] © [Chris Dosé][author] et [al][contributors]\n\n\n[mit]:            https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT\n[author]:         https://github.com/{{USER}}\n[contributors]:   https://github.com/{{USER}}/plugin-asdf/graphs/contributors\n[omf-link]:       https://www.github.com/oh-my-fish/oh-my-fish\n\n[license-badge]:  https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-007EC7.svg?style=flat-square\n"}
