It does so by simply setting some shell variables to colours. If you want to change them, feel free to tweak around with the values.\n\n## Installation\n\nYou should be able to install `colorman` via [oh-my-fish](https://github.com/oh-my-fish/oh-my-fish).\n\n```console\n$ omf install colorman\n```\n\nOtherwise just download the `init.fish` script (possibly rename it `colorman.fish` and source it somewhere in your `config.fish`. \n\n`omf` unfortunately doesn't allow start-hooks so you have to do this next:\n\n```console\n$ echo \"source ~/.local/share/omf/pkg/colorman/init.fish\" \u003e\u003e ~/.config/fish/config.fish\n```\n\nAaand Done ðŸ™‚\n\n## Spelling\n\nThe project is officially spelt \"oh my fish - color manual\", `colorman` for short. But that doesn't mean I have to use wrong gramar (i.e. not spell it *colour* in the README. Just don't be confused :sweat_smile:)\n"}
