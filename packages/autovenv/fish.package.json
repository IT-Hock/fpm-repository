Well, now you can! No complicated scripts,\nbinaries or overhead needed; AutoVenv is a single file, pure `fish` solution.\n\n## Usage\nUpon entering a directory that contains a Python venv (or any directory *above* it) AutoVenv will automatically\nactivate it for you. Likewise, when moving *below* the venv's parent directory AutoVenv will deactivate it!\nAutoVenv can also handle cases where you move directly from one venv directory to another.\n\n## Settings\n    set -U autovenv_enable yes|no\nEnables/disables autovenv functionality.\n\n    set -U autovenv_announce yes|no\nControls whether or not a message is printed when entering/leaving/changing venvs.\n\n## License\n[MIT][mit] Â© [Timothy Brown][author]\n\n[author]: https://github.com/timothybrown\n[license-badge]: https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-007EC7.svg?style=flat-square\n[mit]: http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT\n[omf]: https://github.com/oh-my-fish/oh-my-fish"}
