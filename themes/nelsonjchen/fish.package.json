Based on re5et in Oh-My-Zsh.\n\n## Install\n\n```fish\n$ omf u nelsonjchen\n```\n\n## Features and Differences\n\n* Pretty colors\n* Two line prompt\n* Git Prompt using off-the-shelf fish functions\n  * Note that the symbology, colors, and features are more than the `zsh` version and they don't match up 1-to-1. For example, checking out a tag will show the tag name in `fish` but the re5et version in `zsh` will simply show the commit ID. This was one such freebie amongst many I just left in while porting since the `fish` script was giving it to me for free anyway. It is still pretty close though.\n* Red user prompt if `root`\n* 12 hour clock\n  * re5et: 24 hour clock\n* MM DD YY date format\n  * re5et: YY MM DD date format\n* Title Setting to the `prompt_pwd` function in fish for screen, tmux, and non-terminal multiplexer.\n  * This is derived from [@chgu82837's theme](https://github.com/chgu82837/theme-PastFish/blob/39af8e2885e308501bb0afa9dedab193a8722cfe/fish_prompt.fish#L82-L90)\n\n## Omissions from the re5et version\n\n* Trimming down the working directory display only works on `~`. The original re5et prompt would also trim based on the current environment variables set. For example, if you had the environment variable `FOO` set to `/usr/local` and you did `cd /usr/local`, you would see `$FOO/` in the prompt as the current working directory. I'm not sure how I would get this working. `fish` does appear to have a condensation function but it goes beyond simple environment variable replacement and I can't figure out how to turn it off.\n\n## Screenshot\n\n\u003cp align=\"center\"\u003e\n\u003cimg\nsrc=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5363/12106487/fe8b3c30-b314-11e5-9cbe-8b0e57dde741.png\"\u003e\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\n# License\n\n[MIT][mit] Â© [Nelson Chen][author] et [al][contributors]\n\n\n[mit]:            http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT\n[author]:         http://github.com/nelsonjchen\n[contributors]:   https://github.com/nelsonjchen/omf-theme-nelsonjchen/graphs/contributors\n[omf-link]:       https://www.github.com/oh-my-fish/oh-my-fish\n\n[license-badge]:  https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-007EC7.svg?style=flat-square\n[travis-badge]:   http://img.shields.io/travis/nelsonjchen/omf-theme-nelsonjchen.svg?style=flat-square\n"}
