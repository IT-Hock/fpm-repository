Set the following two lines in your config.fish to turn on this feature:\n    \n    ```fish\n    set -g theme display_user yes\n    set -g default_user your_default_username\n    ```\n\n#### Troubleshooting in iTerm\nIf you see a colored anchor icon instead of the white one, this is because your system font is lacking the anchor icon, and iTerm defaults to the Apple Emoji Font. To get the right icon, either add it to your current font, or chose a powerline font that has it (like Meslo for Powerline, available in https://github.com/powerline/fonts), and select it for your Non-ASCII font.\n"}
