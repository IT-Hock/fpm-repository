To that end, this theme outputs a horizontal bar across the display for each and every prompt. On the second line, only the return status of the previous command (if it was not 0), your username, your hostname, and your working directory are displayed. If this information should ever happen to take up more than two fifths of the screen, the actual prompt is displayed on a third line, giving you plenty of space to type.\n\nBy default the full working directory without any of Fish's normal abbreviations will be displayed. This can be easily overridden by setting the \"Use_Fish_PWD\" variable to anything in your init file. Given that the prompt will go to a third line if the working directory is too long, I don't find the abbreviations to be very useful, but the choise is yours. You can also use the '%' character as your prompt instead of '$' by setting the \"csh_junkie\" variable to anything.\n\nThere used to be a noteable bug in Fish in which the \"COLUMNS\" variable, which stores the width of your terminal, is always set to 78 regardless of the terminal's actual size for the first prompt after starting Fish. Afterwards it was set correctly. This unfortunately meant that the horizontal bar would be too short for that first prompt, however it would seem that this bug has been fixed.\n\nPictures always speak a thousand words. Note the former bug manifesting itself after switching to root.\n\n\u003cp align=\"center\"\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"https://i.imgur.com/QftI04P.png\"\u003e\n\u003c/p\u003e\n"}
