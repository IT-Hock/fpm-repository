Not all links are always visible and only show up when you need them.\n\nLinks are entirely customizable, and it is easy to create and customize your own links.\n\nChain comes with six default links (in order from left to right):\n\n- Superuser privileges (`⚡`)\n- Number of running background jobs\n- The current working directory\n- The current Git branch (`⎇`)\n- Git working directory dirty (`±`)\n- Exit status of the last command\n\n### Custom links\nMaking your own links is as simple as writing a small function. A link is rendered using a _link function_, which is just a Fish function that outputs two lines: the first line is the color of the link; the second line is the link text. For example, if we wanted a yellow link that showed the current time, we could write a function like this:\n\n```fish\nfunction time_link\n  echo yellow\n  date '+%H:%M:%S'\nend\n```\n\nNow we can add it to the end of our prompt:\n\n```fish\nchain.push time_link\n```\n\nYour links are saved automatically, so it is not necessary to add `chain.push` commands to your configuration. Running the command once is enough.\n\n\n## Commands\nChain offers several commands you can use to customize and manipulate your prompt. Here is some brief documentation on what these functions do:\n\n### `chain.compile`\nTo improve performance, the prompt function is actually generated from the configuration dynamically, or \"compiled\". Normally this function is called for you when needed.\n\n### `chain.defaults`\nResets the prompt to the default set of links.\n\n### `chain.inspect`\nA neat-looking debug tool that prints out your chain-related configuration, gives a preview of all your enabled links, and dumps the _compiled prompt_ function.\n\n### `chain.multiline`\nToggle multi-line prompt display on and off. A multi-line prompt can make more room for typing if you have a lot of links in your prompt chain.\n\n### `chain.pop`\nRemove the last link in the prompt chain.\n\n### `chain.push \u003cfunction\u003e`\nAdd a _link function_ to the end of the prompt chain.\n\n### `chain.shift`\nRemove the first link in the prompt chain.\n\n### `chain.unshift \u003cfunction\u003e`\nAdd a _link function_ to the beginning of the prompt chain.\n\n\n## Customization\nChain uses several global variables to customize the prompt appearance. The most important one is `$chain_links`: a list of function names that print out a single link in the prompt.\n\nThe glyphs used in the default links can be customized using global variables. Here is a list of glyph-related variables:\n\n- `$chain_prompt_glyph`: The arrow character at the end of the chain, right before the text input.\n- `$chain_git_branch_glyph`: Glyph to indicate the Git branch.\n- `$chain_git_dirty_glyph`: Glyph to indicate that the working branch has uncommitted changes.\n- `$chain_su_glyph`: Glyph to indicate that you have superuser privileges.\n- `$chain_link_open_glyph`: Glyph before each individual chain link (default `\u003c`).\n- `$chain_link_close_glyph`: Glyph after each individual chain link (default `\u003e`).\n\n\n## License\n[MIT][mit] © [coderstephen][author] et [al][contributors]\n\n[mit]:            http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT\n[author]:         https://github.com/coderstephen\n[contributors]:   https://github.com/coderstephen/theme-chain/graphs/contributors\n[omf]:            https://github.com/oh-my-fish/oh-my-fish\n"}
