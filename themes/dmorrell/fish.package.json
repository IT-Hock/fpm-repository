Shows a bright red \"!\" if you are logged in as root.\n\n_Note:_ This theme is designed for a light-on-dark theme like \n    [Solarized](http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized) \nbut should work in a dark-on-light terminal with a few terminal color tweaks.\n\n## Installation\n\nInstall using\n    [Oh My Fish](https://github.com/oh-my-fish/oh-my-fish):\n\n```fish\nomf install https://github.com/reitzig/theme-dmorrell.git \nomf theme dmorrell\n```\n\nSet the list of default users by adding\n\n```fish\nset -g default_user \"me\" \"buddy\"\n```\n\nto your `.config/fish/config.fish`. \nOf course, this only makes sense if you use the same config across multiple accounts.\nYou can also add the same line to your own fork of the theme.\n\n## Acknowledgements\n\n * Derived from Chris Morrell's\n    [cmorrell](https://github.com/oh-my-fish/theme-cmorrell.com).\n   Hence the name, because `d` comes after `c`.\n * Took some hints from Stefan Maric's\n    [bigfish](https://github.com/stefanmaric/bigfish),\n   in particular about smart glyph choices for representing Git status.\n * Grabbed some Git-related code from\n    [git_util](https://github.com/fisherman/git_util).\n"}
