Get in touch if you want MakeMe support in your shell.\n\n## Install using omf\n\n`omf install makeme`\n\n## Install using fisher\n\n`fisher add oakninja/MakeMeFish`\n\nor\n\n`fisher add oakninja/MakeMeFish@next-release`\n\nto get the latest version.\n\nit's also possible to get the previous version by running\n\n`fisher add oakninja/MakeMeFish@previous-version`\n\n## Install manually\n\nDownload and copy `mm.fish` to `~/.config/fish/functions`\n\nor run\n\n`curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OakNinja/MakeMeFish/master/mm.fish?nocache --create-dirs -sLo ~/.config/fish/functions/mm.fish`\n\n## Usage\n\n_Basic usage:_\ntype `mm`, if there is a Makefile in the current working directory, all targets will be listed. Start typing to filter targets.\n\n_Parameters:_\n\n- `-h` or `--help` to print the help.\n- `-f \u003cfilename\u003e` to specify a makefile if you have several in the cwd, or if you have a non-standard name.\n- `-i` to start MakeMefish in interactive mode. In interactive mode, the selected target will be executed and you will then be returned to the selection prompt. Please note that executed commands won't be added to your command history.\n- `\u003cfoo\u003e` eg. add an arbitrary keyword to start MakeMeFish with a pre-populated query (editable at runtime)\n\n## Examples\n\n`mm build` will start `MakeMeFish` with an initial query which will filter for targets containing the substring `build`.\nSimilarly, `mm foo bar` will filter on targets containing both `foo` and `bar`\n\n---\n\n`mm -f MyFancyMakeFile` will start `MakeMeFish` and parse the file `MyFancyMakeFile` instead of trying to find a makefile with a GNU make standard name.\n\n---\n\n`mm -i` will run `MakeMeFish` in interactive mode\n\n---\n\n_All flags and parameters can be combined, and added in any order, eg._\n\n`mm foo -i -f MyFancyMakeFile` is equivalent to `mm -f MyFancyMakeFile foo -i`\n","repository_updated":0},"age":{"name":"age","description":"A fish plugin to get next version from git tag (e.g. v1.0.0)","image":"https://www.github.com/oh-my-fish/oh-my-fish","latest_version":{"version":"","description":"","commit_hash":"","release_date":0},"versions":[],"tags":["fish-plugin"],"author":"nju33","repository":"https://github.com/nju33/fish-age","license":"MIT","dependencies":[],"stars":1,"forks":0,"watchers":1,"issues":0,"updated":1594570820,"full_description":"\u003cimg src=\"https://cdn.rawgit.com/oh-my-fish/oh-my-fish/e4f1c2e0219a17e2c748b824004c8d0b38055c16/docs/logo.svg\" align=\"left\" width=\"144px\" height=\"144px\"/\u003e\n\n#### age\n\n\u003e To get next version from git tag (e.g. v1.0.0)\n\n[![MIT License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-007EC7.svg?style=flat-square)](/LICENSE)\n[![Fish Shell Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/fish-v3.0.0-007EC7.svg?style=flat-square)](https://fishshell.com)\n[![Oh My Fish Framework](https://img.shields.io/badge/Oh%20My%20Fish-Framework-007EC7.svg?style=flat-square)](https://www.github.com/oh-my-fish/oh-my-fish)\n\n\u003cbr/\u003e\n\n## Install\n\n```fish\n$ omf install age\n```\n\n## Usage\n\n```sh\n$ git tag\nv0.0.1\n\n$ age --major\nv1.0.0\n\n$ age --minor\nv0.1.0\n\n$ age --patch\nv0.0.2\n```\n","repository_updated":0},"android-sdk":{"name":"android-sdk","description":"Android SDK integration.","image":"https://www.github.com/oh-my-fish/oh-my-fish","latest_version":{"version":"","description":"","commit_hash":"","release_date":0},"versions":[],"tags":[],"author":"oh-my-fish","repository":"https://github.com/oh-my-fish/plugin-android-sdk","license":"MIT","dependencies":[],"stars":9,"forks":5,"watchers":9,"issues":0,"updated":1658318088,"full_description":"\u003cimg src=\"https://cdn.rawgit.com/oh-my-fish/oh-my-fish/e4f1c2e0219a17e2c748b824004c8d0b38055c16/docs/logo.svg\" align=\"left\" width=\"144px\" height=\"144px\"/\u003e\n\n#### Android SDK\n\u003e Setup ANDROID_HOME and add SDK tools to your PATH.\n\n[![MIT License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-007EC7.svg?style=flat-square)](/LICENSE)\n[![Fish Shell Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/fish-v2.2.0-007EC7.svg?style=flat-square)](https://fishshell.com)\n[![Oh My Fish Framework](https://img.shields.io/badge/Oh%20My%20Fish-Framework-007EC7.svg?style=flat-square)](https://www.github.com/oh-my-fish/oh-my-fish)\n\n\u003cbr/\u003e\n\n\n## Install\n\n```fish\n$ omf install android-sdk\n```\n\n# License\n\n[MIT][mit] © [Oh My Fish][author] et [al][contributors]\n\n\n[mit]:            https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT\n[author]:         https://github.com/oh-my-fish\n[contributors]:   https://github.com/oh-my-fish/plugin-android-sdk/graphs/contributors\n[omf-link]:       https://www.github.com/oh-my-fish/oh-my-fish\n\n[license-badge]:  https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-007EC7.svg?style=flat-square\n","repository_updated":0},"apt":{"name":"apt","description":"Short and friendly command wrapper for APT","image":"","latest_version":{"version":"v1.0.1","description":"Trust me.\n","commit_hash":"master","release_date":1443820180},"versions":[{"commit_hash":"","description":"","release_date":0,"version":""},{"commit_hash":"master","description":"Trust me.\n","release_date":1443820180,"version":"v1.0.1"}],"tags":[],"author":"oh-my-fish","repository":"https://github.com/oh-my-fish/plugin-apt","license":"MIT","dependencies":[],"stars":7,"forks":5,"watchers":7,"issues":3,"updated":1639017549,"full_description":"[![License][license-badge]](#LICENSE)\n\n\u003cdiv align=\"center\"\u003e\n  \u003ca href=\"http://github.com/fish-shell/oh-my-fish\"\u003e\n  \u003cimg width=90px  src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/8317250/8510172/f006f0a4-230f-11e5-98b6-5c2e3c87088f.png\"\u003e\n  \u003c/a\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n# apt\n\nPlugin for [Oh My Fish][omf-link].\n\nA lightweight APT utility for quickly managing APT packages, the package management system typically used in Debian and Ubuntu.\n\n## Install\n\n```fish\n$ omf install apt\n```\n\n\n## Usage\n\nProvides handy shortcuts for common APT commands.

Fear not! The ARGument Understander is here to help you understand clearly the arguments you are given and live a life of happiness.\n\nFocus on writing your function, not on argument parsing. `argu` does the hard work of parsing function arguments for you in a standard way.\n\n\n## Usage\n\n    argu \u003cdefinition\u003e... -- [ARGV...]\n\n`argu` parses a series of arguments by matching each one against a list of option definitions. A definition is simply a special string that describes how that argument is used. For example, if we had an `--awesome` flag, we could match it like this:\n\n```fish\nargu awesome -- $argv\n```\n\nIf `$argv` contained the `--awesome` flag, it would be printed out appropriately. If our utility has multiple flags and options, we can tell `argu` about all of them and have them parsed:\n\n```fish\nargu a awesome b: boring: -- $argv\n```\n\nThis defines four different options. First, we have an `-a` short flag, and a long `--awesome` flag. These are simply boolean in nature and either are present or not. We also define `b:` and `boring:`; the colon (`:`) indicates that these are options that have _values_, which accept a string associated with the option when passed. This will match something like `--boring tutorial` on the command line, where the string `tutorial` is associated with the `boring` option.\n\nWhen defined this way, our options require a value. If a value is not given, such as passing in `-b` by itself, we get an error message. If we want our option values themselves to be optional, add another colon to the end of the definition:\n\n```fish\nargu a awesome b:: boring:: -- $argv\n```\n\nWith this definition, it is OK to use `-b` or `--boring` by themselves or with an associated value.\n\nNow to use our definitions, we simply place the arguments we want to parse (usually `$argv`) after the `--` argument:\n\n```fish\n$ argu a awesome b: boring: -- --awesome -b tutorial\n--awesome\n-b tutorial\n```\n\nIf we try to put some flags into `$argv` that don't match any of our definitions, `argu` will exit and display a message for us:\n\n```fish\n$ argu a awesome b: boring: -- --verbose\nUnknown option `--verbose'.\n```\n\nIf you simply want to pass in some extra values that aren't associated with an option, you can do that too. Every such value will be associated with the underscore (`_`) special option:\n\n```fish\n$ argu a awesome b: boring: -- --awesome -b tutorial extra values\n--awesome\n-b tutorial\n_ extra\n_ values\n```\n\nWhen called, `argu` will parse the given arguments and print out each matching argument name and value. This output can be easily combined with `read` to begin acting on these values:\n\n```fish\n$ argu a awesome b: boring: -- --awesome -b tutorial | while read -l opt value\n  echo \"Option: $opt\"\n  echo \"Value: $value\"\nend\n\nOption: --awesome\nValue:\nOption: -b\nValue: tutorial\n```\n\n\n## Examples\nAn actual code example speaks a thousand words, so here's an example on how `argu` can be used to parse function arguments:\n\n```fish\nfunction my_utility\n  argu l long x: o:: optional:: -- $argv | while read -l opt value\n    switch $opt\n      case -l --long\n        echo handle `-l --long`\n      case -x\n        echo handle `-x` w/ argument `$value`\n      case -o --optional\n        echo handle `-o --optional` w/ optional argument `$value`\n      case _\n        echo operand: `$value`\n    end\n  end\nend\n```\n\n\n## Syntax\n`argu` obtains options and their arguments from a list of parameters that, as indicated by each `\u003cdefinition\u003e`, are single letters preceded by a `-` or words preceded by `--` and possibly followed by an argument value. Each definition has the following grammar:\n\n    \u003cdefinition\u003e  ::= \u003cletter\u003e \u003cvalue\u003e | \u003cword\u003e \u003cvalue\u003e\n    \u003cvalue\u003e       ::= \"\" | \":\" | \"::\"\n\nA definition beginning with `\u003cletter\u003e` defines a short option, while a definition beginning with `\u003cword\u003e` defines a long option. A short option will match `-\u003cletter\u003e`, while a long option will match `--\u003cword\u003e`.\n\nIf a `\u003cletter\u003e` or `\u003cword\u003e` is followed by a `:`, the option is expected to have an argument, which may be supplied separately or next to the option without spaces in the same string. To indicate optional arguments, use an additional `:` character after a `:` at the end of the definition.\n\nBoth required and optional values for arguments can be supplied either in the same string as the option, or in the string following the option. For short options, the value can be appended without spaces, e.g, `-\u003cletter\u003evalue`. For long options, use a `=` character after the option, e.g, `--\u003cword\u003e=value`.\n\nIn general, `argu` parses arguments according to [The Open Group Utility Syntax Guidelines][utilconv], except that it is less restrictive. The following is a summary of the features:\n\n- Short options; single letters preceded by `-`, and long options; words preceded by `--`, are both supported.\n\n- Single letters may be grouped. `-abc` → `-a -b -c`\n\n- Options required to take an argument can specify the argument either in the same string as the option or separated from the by a space. (1) `-a argument`, (2) `-aargument`\n\n- Options that can take an argument optionally shall specify the argument in the same string as the option argument if in short option style: `-aargument`, or separated by a `=` if in long form: `--long-form=argument`. If a blank space is used, the following argument will be treated independently.\n\n- Options can appear multiple times in the same argument list. `argu` will print every match sequentially on each call, and should default to the short form of the option if available.\n\n\n## Relation to getopts\n`argu` has been written from scratch with a new algorithm, to improve performance and provide more consistent parsing. It aims to replace [plugin-getopts], a separate plugin. Inspiration is drawn from this plugin, but the usage and implementation are **not** related nor compatible. See the `README` on the above plugin to compare the changes if you are migrating to `argu` from [plugin-getopts].\n\n\n## Inspiration and related links\n- [The Open Group Base Specifications: Utility Conventions][utilconv]\n- [GNU getopt](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/getopt.1.html)\n- [zparseopts](http://linux.die.net/man/1/zshmodules)\n- Credit goes to https://github.com/fishery/getopts for the `while read` idea for reading options.\n\n\n## License\n[MIT][mit] © [Stephen Coakley][author].

Bass\n\n![](https://travis-ci.org/edc/bass.svg?branch=master)\n\nBass makes it easy to use utilities written for Bash in [fish shell](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/).\n\nRegular bash scripts can be used in fish shell just as scripts written in any language with proper shebang or explicitly using the interpreter (i.e. using `bash script.sh`). However, many utilities, such as virtualenv, modify the shell environment and need to be sourced, and therefore cannot be used in fish. Sometimes, counterparts (such as the excellent [virtualfish](http://virtualfish.readthedocs.org/en/latest/)) are created, but that's often not the case.\n\nBass is created to make it possible to use bash utilities in fish shell without any modification. It works by capturing what environment variables are modified by the utility of interest, and replay the changes in fish.\n\nYou might not need Bass for simple use cases. A great simple alternative (suggested by @jorgebucaran) is to just use `exec bash -c \"source some-bash-setup.sh; exec fish\"`.\n\n# Installation\n\nBass is compatible with fish versions 2.6.0 and later.\n\n\n## Manually\n\nUse the Makefile.\n\n`make install` will copy two files to `~/.config/fish/functions/`.\n\n`make uninstall` will remove those two files.\n\nRelaunch the shell for the change to take effect.\n\n## With [Oh My Fish](https://github.com/oh-my-fish/oh-my-fish)\n\n```console\nomf install bass\n```\n\n## With [Fisher](https://github.com/jorgebucaran/fisher)\n\n```console\nfisher install edc/bass\n```\n\n## With [Fundle](https://github.com/tuvistavie/fundle)\n\nAdd\n\n```console\nfundle plugin 'edc/bass'\n```\n\nto your fish config, relaunch the shell and run `fundle install`.\n\n# Example\n\nBass is simple to use. Just prefix your bash utility command with `bass`:\n\n```\n\u003e bass export X=3\n\u003e echo $X\n3\n```\n\nNotice that `export X=3` is bash syntax. Bass \"transported\" the new bash\nenvironment variable back to fish.\n\nBass has a debug option so you can see what happened:\n\n```\n\u003e bass -d export X=4\n# updating X=3 -\u003e 4\nset -g -x X 4\n```\n\n## nvm\n\nHere is a more realistic example, using the excellent\n[nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm):\n\n```\n\u003e bass source ~/.nvm/nvm.sh --no-use ';' nvm use iojs\nNow using io.js v1.1.0\n```\n\nNote that semicolon is quoted to avoid being consumed by fish.\n\nThis example takes advantage of the nvm bash utility to switch to iojs.\nAfter the command, iojs is accessible:\n\n```\n\u003e which iojs\n/Users/edc/.nvm/versions/io.js/v1.1.0/bin/iojs\n```\n\nYou can then very easily pack the command as a function and feel more at home:\n\n```\n\u003e funced nvm\nnvm\u003e function nvm\n           bass source ~/.nvm/nvm.sh --no-use ';' nvm $argv\n       end\n\n\u003e nvm list\n-\u003e  iojs-v1.1.0\n         system\n\u003e nvm ls-remote\n        v0.1.14\n        v0.1.15\n...\n```\n\n(`--no-use` is an important option to `nvm.sh`. See [#13](https://github.com/edc/bass/issues/13) for background.)\n","repository_updated":0},"battery":{"name":"battery","description":"OS X and Linux compatible battery

Why can't we just set those environment variables in our shell configuration instead of using this plugin? Well, if we simply set environment variables, they contain escape sequences that will \"overflow\" into the output of other commands reading environment variables. See this [Stackoverflow question](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/87261/getting-unexpected-colorized-output-on-several-commands) for an explanation.\n\n\u003cimg alt=\"colored man page for less\" src=\"./images/less-man-page.png\"\u003e\n\nCredits: This idea was first inspired by [Arch Linux wiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Color_output_in_console#Using_less).\n\nNote: [decors/fish-colored-man](https://github.com/decors/fish-colored-man) is a very similar plugin. Differences:\n\n- `colored_man_pages.fish` includes a wrapper to also colorize the output of utilities that rely on less, such as `git help`\n- `fish-colored-man` allows configuring colors\n\n\n\n## Install\n\nWith [fisher]\n\n```fish\n$ fisher install patrickf1/colored_man_pages.fish\n```\n\n## Usage\n\nJust invoke `man` as usual, but without changing the pager, to get colored output. For example\n\n```fish\n$ man less\n```\n\nTo execute vanilla `man` without colored output, we can bypass the wrapper using `command`.

The name of your plugin is usually a good choice.\n\nReading a config value looks like this:\n\n    config my-namespace --get my-property\n\nFor all of `config`'s actions, the namespace must always be the first argument. In the above command, the value of the `my-property` _key_ in the `my-namespace` _namespace_ will be printed to standard output.\n\nKey names can have their own hierarchy. To add additional layers of grouping, you can separate names with a dot (`.`):\n\n    config my-namespace --get misc.colors.header\n\nThe nesting isn't just a nice convention; the nesting will actually be reflected in the storage backing (more on that in a bit).\n\nSetting values is similar to getting them. We can set `misc.colors.header` to `red` as follows:\n\n    config my-namespace --set misc.colors.header red\n\nIf you need to check what all of your config values are at once, you can see a pretty list of key-value pairs with\n\n    config my-namespace --list\n\nThere are more operations than just getting and setting that you can do on your configuration. Check the output of `config --help` for a complete list of actions and options.\n\n\n## Config files\nConfig values are stored in individual files and directories in `$FISH_CONFIG`. A directory is created for each namespace to hold config files at `$FISH_CONFIG/my-namespace`. When using Oh My Fish! (the default), `$FISH_CONFIG` will be the same as `$OMF_CONFIG`. Otherwise it will be set to `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME`, or fall back to `$HOME/.config`.\n\nEach key gets its own file inside the namespace directory. For example, if you have a key called `email` in a `mailer` namespace, you can expect a file at `$FISH_CONFIG/mailer/email` to exist, which contains as text the value of that key. If a key is nested, like our `misc.colors.header` example from earlier, each level of nesting is made into a directory separator. `misc.colors.header` then would be stored in `$FISH_CONFIG/namespace/misc/colors/header`.\n\nNote that a key cannot hold both subkeys and a value.\n\n\n## Command-line config editing\nThere's a reason why the `config` command has slightly odd ordering of arguments. You can easily embed the `config` command into your own plugin with minimal effort. Let's say you develop a plugin called `fancy-echo` that prints out text prefixed with a configurable string. A good way to store this string would be in the `prefix` key under the `fancy-echo` namespace. In our plugin, we can read that property with\n\n    config fancy-echo --get prefix\n\nNow if the user wants to change this value without opening up and editing the corresponding config file, the user can use the `config` command themselves:\n\n    config fancy-echo --set prefix \"This just in: \"\n\nWe can make this easier by copying Git's `config` command syntax:\n\n```fish\nfunction fe -d \"Fancy echo\"\n  if begin; set -q argv[1]; and test \"$argv[1]\" = config; end\n    # Pass arguments on to `config`\n    config fancy-echo $argv[2..-1]\n    return\n  end\nend\n```\n\nNow we can edit `fancy-echo`'s config with `fancy-echo`'s own command!\n\n    fe config --set prefix \"This just in: \"\n\nIf the user needs some help, they can still use `fe config --help`; the help text will adapt automatically to match the package it is embedded in.\n\n\n## License\n[MIT][mit] © [coderstephen][author] et [al][contributors]\n\n\n[mit]:            http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT\n[author]:         http://github.com/coderstephen\n[contributors]:   https://github.com/oh-my-fish/plugin-config/graphs/contributors\n[omf-link]:       https://www.github.com/oh-my-fish/oh-my-fish\n[license-badge]:  https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-007EC7.svg?style=flat-square\n","repository_updated":0},"direnv":{"name":"direnv","description":"Unclutter your .profile http://direnv.net","image":"https://www.github.com/oh-my-fish/oh-my-fish","latest_version":{"version":"","description":"","commit_hash":"","release_date":0},"versions":[],"tags":[],"author":"oh-my-fish","repository":"https://github.com/oh-my-fish/plugin-direnv","license":"MIT","dependencies":[],"stars":12,"forks":9,"watchers":12,"issues":4,"updated":1667849095,"full_description":"\u003cimg src=\"https://cdn.rawgit.com/oh-my-fish/oh-my-fish/e4f1c2e0219a17e2c748b824004c8d0b38055c16/docs/logo.svg\" align=\"left\" width=\"144px\" height=\"144px\"/\u003e\n\n#### direnv\n\u003e [direnv] integration for [Oh My Fish][omf-link].\n\n[![MIT License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-007EC7.svg?style=flat-square)](/LICENSE)\n[![Fish Shell Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/fish-v2.2.0-007EC7.svg?style=flat-square)](http://fishshell.com)\n[![Oh My Fish Framework](https://img.shields.io/badge/Oh%20My%20Fish-Framework-007EC7.svg?style=flat-square)](https://www.github.com/oh-my-fish/oh-my-fish)\n\n\u003cbr/\u003e\n\n## Install\n\n```fish\n$ omf install direnv\n```\n\n\n## Usage\n\nSee [official direnv documentation][direnv].\n\n# License\n\n[MIT][mit] © [Derek W.

an interactive filter :sparkles:\n\n## Description\n\n`cd` command is one of the frequently used commands.\n\nNevertheless, it is not so easy to handle unfortunately. A directory path given as an argument to `cd` command must be a valid path that exists and is able to resolve. In other words, you cannot pass a partial path such as \"dir\" (you are in `/home/lisa`, dir is `/home/lisa/work/dir`) to `cd` command.\n\nThe new cd command called \"enhancd\" enhanced the flexibility and usability for a user. enhancd will memorize all directories visited by a user and use it for the pathname resolution. If the log of enhancd have more than one directory path with the same name, enhancd will pass the candidate directories list to the filter within the ENHANCD_FILTER environment variable in order to narrow it down to one directory.\n\nThanks to this mechanism, the user can intuitively and easily change the directory you want to go.\n\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/b4b4r07/screenshots/master/enhancd/demo.gif)\n\n## Features\n\n- Go to the visited directory in the past\n- Easy to filter, using your favorite filter\n- Work on Bash, Zsh and fish (cross-shell compatibility)\n- Go back to a specific parent directory like [zsh-bd](https://github.com/Tarrasch/zsh-bd)\n- Inside a git repo, the first list element is the git root directory\n- Fuzzy search in a similar name directory\n- Support standard input (`echo $HOME | cd` is acceptable)\n- Custom options (user-defined option is acceptable)\n\n## Issues\n\n- Fish version\n  - Because of how fish piping works, it's not possible to pipe to cd like : `ls / | cd`\n\n\n### Fuzzy search\n\nYou can fuzzy-search a directory name you want to run `cd`. For example, a word \"text\" is expand to \"test\" and \"txt\".\n\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/b4b4r07/screenshots/master/enhancd/fuzzy.gif)\n\n## Requirements\n\n- An interactive filter\n\n  - [**fzy**](https://github.com/jhawthorn/fzy)\n  - [**percol**](https://github.com/mooz/percol)\n  - [**peco**](https://github.com/peco/peco)\n  - [**fzf**](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf)\n  - ...\n\n  Choose any one from among these.\n\n## Usage\n\nUnder Zsh or Bourne shells such as sh and bash, you just source `init.sh` into your shell:\n\n```console\n$ source ./init.sh\n```\n\nBecause enhancd functions must be executed in the context of the current shell, you should run something like above command.\n\nThe basic usage of the `cd` command that has been implemented by `enhancd` is the same as the normal builtin `cd` command.\n\n```console\n$ cd [-|..] \u003cdirectory\u003e\n```\n\nIf no arguments are given, enhancd `cd` command will display a list of the directory you've visited once, encourage you to filter the directory that you want to move.\n\n```console\n$ cd\n  ...\n  /home/lisa/src/github.com/b4b4r07/enhancd/zsh\n  /home/lisa/src/github.com/b4b4r07/gotcha\n  /home/lisa/src/github.com/b4b4r07/blog/public\n  /home/lisa/src/github.com/b4b4r07/blog\n  /home/lisa/src/github.com/b4b4r07/link_test\n  /home/lisa/src/github.com/b4b4r07\n  /home/lisa/Dropbox/etc/dotfiles\n  /home/lisa/src/github.com/b4b4r07/enhancd\n\u003e /home/lisa\n  247/247\n\u003e _\n```\n\nThe ENHANCD_FILTER variable is specified as a list of one or more visual filter command such as [this](#heartbeat-requirements) separated by colon (`:`) characters.\n\nIt is likely the only environment variable you'll need to set when starting enhancd.\n\n```console\n$ ENHANCD_FILTER=peco; export ENHANCD_FILTER\n```\n\nSince the `$ENHANCD_FILTER` variable can be a list, enhancd will use `$ENHANCD_FILTER` to mean the first element unless otherwise specified.\n\n```console\n$ ENHANCD_FILTER=fzy:fzf:peco\n$ export ENHANCD_FILTER\n```\n\nAlso,\n\n\u003cdetails\u003e\n\u003csummary\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHyphen (\u003ccode\u003e-\u003c/code\u003e)\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/summary\u003e\n\nWhen enhancd takes a hyphen (`-`) string as an argument, it searchs from the last 10 directory items in the log. With it, you can search easily the directory you used last.\n\n```console\n$ cd -\n  /home/lisa/Dropbox/etc/dotfiles\n  /home/lisa/Dropbox\n  /home/lisa/src/github.com\n  /home/lisa/src/github.com/b4b4r07/cli\n  /home\n  /home/lisa/src\n  /home/lisa/src/github.com/b4b4r07/enhancd\n  /home/lisa/src/github.com/b4b4r07/gotcha\n  /home/lisa/src/github.com/b4b4r07\n\u003e /home/lisa/src/github.com/b4b4r07/portfolio\n  10/10\n\u003e _\n```\n\nThen, since the current directory will be delete from the candidate, you just press Enter key to return to the previous directory after type `cd -` (`$PWD` is `/home/lisa`, `$OLDPWD` is `/home/lisa/src/github.com/b4b4r07/portfolio`).\n\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/b4b4r07/screenshots/master/enhancd/cd_hyphen.gif)\n\n\u003c/details\u003e\n\n\u003cdetails\u003e\n\u003csummary\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDouble-dot (\u003ccode\u003e..\u003c/code\u003e)\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/summary\u003e\n\nFrom the beginning, `..` means the directory's parent directory, that is, the directory that contains it. When enhancd takes a double-dot (`..`) string as an argument, it behaves like a [zsh-bd](https://github.com/Tarrasch/zsh-bd) plugin. In short, you can jump back to a specific directory, without doing `cd ../../..`.\n\nFor example, when you are in `/home/lisa/src/github.com/b4b4r07/enhancd`, type `cd ..` in your terminal:\n\n```console\n$ cd ..\n  /\n  home\n  lisa\n  src\n  github.com\n\u003e b4b4r07\n  6/6\n\u003e _\n```\n\nWhen moving to the parent directory, the current directory is removed from the candidate.\n\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/b4b4r07/screenshots/master/enhancd/bd.gif)\n\n\u003c/details\u003e\n\n\n### Enhancd complete (fish)\n\nOn fish shell, you can use `alt+f` to trigger `enhancd` when typing a command, the selected item will be appended to the commandline\n\n### Options\n\n```console\n$ cd --help\nusage: cd [OPTIONS] [dir]\n\nOPTIONS:\n  -h, --help       Show help message\n```\n\nThose options are defined at [config.ltsv](https://github.com/b4b4r07/enhancd/blob/master/config.ltsv). As it is written in this json, the user have to make a directory list file or script that generate the list like [this script](https://github.com/b4b4r07/enhancd/blob/master/src/custom/sources/ghq.sh). Of cource, you can disable those options if you do not like it.\n\n## Installation\n\n### Declarative way (bash/zsh/fish):\n\nUsing CLI package manager \"[afx](https://github.com/b4b4r07/afx)\".

What is ENHANCD_FILTER?\n\n   The ENHANCD_FILTER is an environment variable. It looks exactly like the PATH variable containing with many different filters such as [peco](https://github.com/peco/peco) concatenated using '`:`'.\n\n2. How to set the ENHANCD_FILTER variable?\n\n   Setting the ENHANCD_FILTER variable is exactly like setting the PATH variable. For example:\n\n   ```console\n   $ export ENHANCD_FILTER=\"/usr/local/bin/peco:fzf:non-existing-filter\"\n   ```\n\n   This above command will hold good till the session is closed. In order to make this change permanent, we need to put this command in the appropriate profile file. The ENHANCD_FILTER command in this example is set with 3 components: `/usr/local/bin/peco` followed by `fzf` and the `not-existing-filter`.\n\n   enhancd narrows the ENHANCD_FILTER variable down to one. However, the command does not exist can not be the candidate.\n\n   Let us try to test this ENHANCD_FILTER variable.\n\n   ```console\n   $ cd\n   ```\n\n   If cd command does not return error, the settings of ENHANCD_FILTER is success.\n\n3. How to find the value of the ENHANCD_FILTER variable?\n\n   ```console\n   $ echo $ENHANCD_FILTER\n   /usr/local/bin/peco:fzf:non-existing-filter\n   ```\n\n\u003c/details\u003e\n\n\u003cdetails\u003e\n\u003csummary\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003ccode\u003eENHANCD_COMMAND\u003c/code\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/summary\u003e\n\nThe ENHANCD_COMMAND environment variable is to change the command name of enhancd `cd`. It defaults to `cd`.\n\nWhen the command name is changed, you should set new command name to ENHANCD_COMMAND, export it and restart your shell (reload `init.sh`).\n\n```console\n$ echo $ENHANCD_COMMAND\ncd\n$ export ENHANCD_COMMAND=ecd\n$ source /path/to/init.sh\n```\n\nThe ENHANCD_COMMAND may only hold one command name. Thus, in the previous example, it is true that enhancd `cd` command name is `ecd`, but it is not `cd` (`cd` is turned into original `builtin cd`).\n\nBesides putting a setting such as this one in your `~/.bash_profile` or `.zshenv` would be a good idea:\n\n```bash\nENHANCD_COMMAND=ecd; export ENHANCD_COMMAND\n```\n\n\u003c/details\u003e\n\n\u003cdetails\u003e\n\u003csummary\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003ccode\u003eENHANCD_DISABLE_DOT\u003c/code\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/summary\u003e\n\nIf you don't want to use the interactive filter, when specifing a double dot (`..`), you should set not zero value to `$ENHANCD_DISABLE_DOT`.

A word expansion is a real-time substitution of the words you type on the command line. It is a bit like `abbr`, but dynamic and extensible and a whole lot more awesome.\n\n\n[![asciicast](https://asciinema.org/a/39860.png)](https://asciinema.org/a/39860)\n\n\n## Install\n```fish\n$ omf install expand\n```\n\n\n## Using it\nUsing expansions already provided by your installed plugins couldn't be any easier. Word expansions are triggered when you use the \u003ckbd\u003eTAB\u003c/kbd\u003e key when the cursor is over a word. Before checking for regular command completions, the current word will be checked against available word expansions. If a suitable expansion is found, the current word will be replaced with the result of the expansion.\n\nIf more than one suitable expansion is found for the current word, `expand` will attempt to use an _interactive filter_ tool to allow you to choose interactively which expansion you would like to use (or none if you don't want any of them). By default, `expand` will use the filter command specified in the `$FILTER` environment variable. If a filter is not specified, `expand` will look for some popular ones if you have them installed:\n\n- [fzf]: A command-line fuzzy finder written in Go.\n- [peco]: The simplistic interactive filtering tool, written in Go.\n- [percol]: An interactive grep tool written in Python.\n- [selecta]: A fuzzy text selector written in Ruby.\n\nIf no filters are specified or installed, you can still cycle through all of the available replacements by pressing \u003ckbd\u003eTAB\u003c/kbd\u003e repeatedly.\n\nIf you decide that you want to cancel the current expansion, you can press \u003ckbd\u003eBackspace\u003c/kbd\u003e to undo the expansion.\n\nExpansions can be more than simple abbreviations; the current word can be used to introduce patterns and queries to provide dynamic expansions in real-time.\n\n\n## Writing expansions\nWriting your own expansions is incredibly simple. There are two parts to a word expansion: a condition, and an expander. A condition is the means of specifying on what words your expander should be run. The expander is a script or function that takes the current word and produces a replacement as its output. Below is a simple but useful example that lets you expand a substitution syntax (like `s/something/something else`) into the previous command with the substitution applied:\n\n```fish\nexpand-word -p '^s/..*/.*$' -e 'echo -n \"$history[1]\" | sed -e (commandline -t)/g'\n```\n\nAnd that's really all that you need! Try running the above command, and then try pressing the tab key on a substitution:\n\n```fish\n$ git stats\ngit: 'stats' is not a git command. See 'git --help'.\n\nDid you mean this?\n        status\n$ s/stats/status\u003cTab\u003e\n$ git status\n```\n\nThe `expand-word` function registers a new expander by specifying the condition and the expander itself as option arguments. There are two interesting flags used in this expansion: `-p` and `-e`. First let's look at what `-e` is doing. This flag is short for the `--expander` option, which specifies the expander function or script to run. The expander uses the builtin [`commandline`][commandline] command to print the current _token_, or word, that is being expanded and uses it as a substitution expression with `sed`. The replaced command is then printed out, and the output is used by `expand` to replace the current word.\n\nYou can do pretty much anything you like in an expander. All you are required to do is print the desired replacement for the current word to standard output, and `expand` will do the rest. Now let's look closer at how we can use conditions to properly choose when our expander should run.\n\n\n### Conditions\nThere are two different types of conditions currently available: patterns, or functions.\n\nA pattern condition is an [extended regular expression][regex] that is matched against the current word. If the word matches, the corresponding expander is used. Let's look at how we can use a pattern to run an expander on words that start with `git`:\n\n```fish\nexpand-word -p '^git.+' -e 'some_expander_function'\n```\n\nThe `^git.+` pattern will match any word that starts with `git`, but not `git` itself. Keep in mind that the regular expression format is the POSIX ERE syntax, not PCRE. Check the `grep` manual for a good guide to this syntax.\n\nThe second type of condition is more interesting; a function condition is a script or function that is run each time you attempt to expand a word. The function can perform any logic you need to perform in order to correctly determine if your expander can expand the current word. If the word is of a format that your expander is expecting, your function should return `0` to tell `expand` to use your expander. If the function cannot expand the given word, a non-zero value should be returned instead, and expander will be skipped.\n\nFor performance reasons, you may want to put some effort into optimizing a condition function, since _all_ of the condition functions will run every time you expand a word. If you have a lot of expansions or slow conditions, you may experience some lag when expanding words.\n\nBelow is an example of using a function as an expansion condition:\n\n```fish\nfunction should_expand_home\n  if test (commandline -t) != \"home\" -a \"$PWD\" != \"$HOME\"\n    return 1\n  end\nend\n\nexpand-word -c 'should_expand_home' -e 'echo $HOME'\n```\n\nThis expansion will only be used on the word \"home\", but only if you are not currently in your home directory. Pretty cool, eh?\n\n\n### Giving up\nIn addition to conditions, you can also have your expanders \"give up\" prematurely when trying to expand a word by returning a non-zero exit code. If your expander gives up a word, it will be ignored and the next expander will be used as normal.\n\n\n## License\n[MIT][mit] © [Stephen Coakley][author] et [al][contributors]\n\n\n[author]:

Named colors are _autocompleted_.\n\n* To \"skip\" an argument (e.g. use the default), just pass an empty one:\n\n  ```fish\n  fish_logo f00 '' ff0\n  ```\n\n* If you don't want colors, you can use\n\n  ```fish\n  fish_logo normal normal normal\n  ```\n\n* There are several variations of the logo with different symbols used for its \"mouth\" and eye. The defaults correspond to the logo on the fish-shell website. Another variation of the logo seen in the wild uses `L` and `@` symbols:\n\n  ```fish\n  fish_logo '' '' '' L @\n  ```\n\n  This really affects how the fish looks, so try to experiment with it yourself.\n\n* You can add this logo to your [fish greeting](http://fish.sh/docs/current/index.html#greeting) with this function:\n\n  ```fish\n  function fish_greeting\n      fish_logo\n  end\n  ```\n\n  Just write it to `~/.config/fish/functions/fish_greeting.fish` and you will see it every time you start a new session.\n\n\n## Examples\n\nNote, that named colors will be interpreted by _your terminal_, so the overall look of the logo will \"adapt\" to your terminal color scheme.  \n\nThe orange color is not in the standard 8-colors palette, so the default for it is hardcoded, but anyway it should look well with different variations of red and yellow.\n\n| Terminal |  Typeface  | Color Schemes |\n|:--------:|:----------:|:-------------:|\n| [iTerm2] | [mononoki] |   [base16]    |\n\n|

the type of the selected path.\n+　　- If it is \"directory\", execute cd\n+　　- If it is HTML, it opens in the web browser\n+　　- If it is Text, it will be opened with your favorite editor\n```\n\n### :whale: Acquire pass only from DB\n```diff\n+ Ctrl-k will copy the path under the cursor to the clipboard\n+ After copying it returns to the command line so you can paste with Shift - Insert etc.\n+　　- The path obtained by this can be an argument such as grep, cp, mv, diff, ls\n```\n\n### :whale: Initial DB construction applied high speed correspondence\n```diff\n+ DB Collect file paths using machine specifications as much as possible only when it is first constructed.\n```\n\n### :whale: Automatic DB update after the second time\n```diff\n+ Use fishingz for a certain number of times, or automatic update is performed when a certain time has passed since immediately after DB construction\n+　　- The threshold up to DB update can be set freely\n+　　- When rebuilding the DB, it is done with the machine load reduced in the background (load change is also possible)\n+　　- Scheduler registration such as cron, at etc. is unnecessary because the update opportunity is simple\n```\n\n### :whale: File can be searched from DB by sonar command which is a subset\n```diff\n+ After DB construction, you can search files from DB using sonar command.\n+　　- The usage of the

environment wraps application execution in a way that environment variables that are exported or modified get imported back into fish. This makes possible running popular bash scripts, like the excellent `nvm`.\n\n\n# Install\n\nBe sure to have [Oh My Fish][omf-link] installed, so you just need to:\n\n```fish\nomf install foreign-env\n```\n\nIf you dislike shell frameworks, you can still use Foreign Environment in Fish! Clone this repo somewhere and append to your `~/.config/fish/config.fish`:\n\n```fish\nset fish_function_path $fish_function_path \u003cinsert path to foreign-env repo\u003e/functions\n```\n\n\n# Usage examples\n\nYou can use bash syntax to export variables:\n\n```fish\nfenv export PYTHON=python2\n```\n\nThis will have the same effect as typing:\n\n```fish\nset -g -x PYTHON python2\n```\n\nYou can also call multiple commands, separated by semicolon:\n\n```fish\nfenv source ~/.nvm/nvm.sh \\; nvm --help\n```\n\nWhen commands aren't double quoted, you need to escape semicolon with slash `\\;` to prevent fish from interpreting it. Or just quote the whole command:\n\n```fish\nfenv \"source ~/.nvm/nvm.sh; nvm --help\"\n```\n\n\n# Caveats\n\n* Currently we only handle environment variables that are added or modified. If a variable is unset (removed from environment) it will not be removed from fish.\n\n# License\n\n[MIT][mit] © [Derek Willian Stavis][author]\n\n\n[mit]:            http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT\n[author]:         http://github.com/derekstavis\n[omf-link]:       https://www.github.com/oh-my-fish/oh-my-fish\n","repository_updated":0},"fuck":{"name":"fuck","description":"Execute last command as root in fish","image":"https://www.github.com/oh-my-fish/oh-my-fish","latest_version":{"version":"","description":"","commit_hash":"","release_date":0},"versions":[],"tags":[],"author":"RubieV","repository":"https://github.com/RubieV/plugin-fuck","license":"MIT","dependencies":[],"stars":3,"forks":0,"watchers":3,"issues":0,"updated":1596982257,"full_description":"\u003cimg src=\"https://cdn.rawgit.com/oh-my-fish/oh-my-fish/e4f1c2e0219a17e2c748b824004c8d0b38055c16/docs/logo.svg\" align=\"left\" width=\"144px\" height=\"144px\"/\u003e\n\n#### fuck\n\u003e A plugin for [Oh My Fish][omf-link].\n\n[![MIT License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-007EC7.svg?style=flat-square)](/LICENSE)\n[![Fish Shell Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/fish-v2.2.0-007EC7.svg?style=flat-square)](https://fishshell.com)\n[![Oh My Fish Framework](https://img.shields.io/badge/Oh%20My%20Fish-Framework-007EC7.svg?style=flat-square)](https://www.github.com/oh-my-fish/oh-my-fish)\n\n\u003cbr/\u003e\n\n\n## Install\n\n```fish\n$ omf install fuck\n```\n\n\n## Usage\n\nExecute last command as sudo\n\n```fish\n$ whoami\nuser\n$ fuck\nroot\n```\n\n\n# License\n\n[MIT][mit] © [Ruben van Vreeland][author] et [al][contributors]\n\n\n[mit]:            https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT\n[author]:         https://github.com/rubiev\n[contributors]:   https://github.com/rubiev/plugin-fuck/graphs/contributors\n[omf-link]:       https://www.github.com/oh-my-fish/oh-my-fish\n\n[license-badge]:  https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-007EC7.svg?style=flat-square\n","repository_updated":0},"fzf":{"name":"fzf","description":"Ef-🐟-ient fish keybindings for fzf","image":"","latest_version":{"version":"","description":"","commit_hash":"","release_date":0},"versions":[],"tags":["fish-shell","fisher","fzf"],"author":"jethrokuan","repository":"https://github.com/jethrokuan/fzf","license":"MIT","dependencies":[],"stars":800,"forks":66,"watchers":800,"issues":26,"updated":1672731327,"full_description":"# Fzf\n\nIntegrate [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf) (command-line fuzzy finder) functionality into [Fish](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell).

It lacks fzf tab completion but includes functions for searching git log, git status, and browsing shell variables using fzf. Additionally, it is more likely to be maintained going forward. You can read more about the differences between it and this plugin on this `fzf.fish` [Wiki page](https://github.com/PatrickF1/fzf.fish/wiki/Prior-Art).\n- The `fzf` utility ships with its [own out-of-the-box Fish integration](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf/blob/master/shell/key-bindings.fish). What sets this package apart is that it has better shell integration, most notably tab completions. They are not compatible so use one or the other.\n\n[tmux]: https://tmux.github.io/\n\n## License\n\n[MIT](LICENSE.md)\n","repository_updated":0},"fzf-autojump":{"name":"fzf-autojump","description":"Fish shell plugin for autojump and fzf integration","image":"https://www.github.com/oh-my-fish/oh-my-fish","latest_version":{"version":"","description":"","commit_hash":"","release_date":0},"versions":[],"tags":["autojump","fish","fzf","omf"],"author":"rominf","repository":"https://github.com/rominf/omf-plugin-fzf-autojump","license":"MIT","dependencies":[],"stars":4,"forks":1,"watchers":4,"issues":1,"updated":1628460735,"full_description":"\u003cimg src=\"https://cdn.rawgit.com/oh-my-fish/oh-my-fish/e4f1c2e0219a17e2c748b824004c8d0b38055c16/docs/logo.svg\" align=\"left\" width=\"144px\" height=\"144px\"/\u003e\n\n#### fzf-autojump\n\u003e A plugin for [Oh My Fish][omf-link].\n\n[![MIT License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-007EC7.svg?style=flat-square)](/LICENSE)\n[![Fish Shell Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/fish-v2.2.0-007EC7.svg?style=flat-square)](https://fishshell.com)\n[![Oh My Fish Framework](https://img.shields.io/badge/Oh%20My%20Fish-Framework-007EC7.svg?style=flat-square)](https://www.github.com/oh-my-fish/oh-my-fish)\n\n\u003cbr/\u003e\n\nAdds dirs from the autojump database to the fzf list.\n\nRequires fzf plugin (https://github.com/fisherman/fzf).\n\n## Install\n\n```fish\n$ omf install fzf-autojump\n```\n\n\n## Usage\n\nTo invoke, press `Alt + Shift + H`.\n\nManual invocation:\n\n```fish\n$ __fzf_autojump\n```\n\n\n# License\n\n[MIT][mit] © [Roman Inflianskas][author] et [al][contributors]\n\n\n[mit]:            https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT\n[author]:         https://github.com/{{USER}}\n[contributors]:   https://github.com/{{USER}}/plugin-fzf-autojump/graphs/contributors\n[omf-link]:       https://www.github.com/oh-my-fish/oh-my-fish\n\n[license-badge]:  https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-007EC7.svg?style=flat-square\n","repository_updated":0},"gem":{"name":"gem","description":"Ruby gem integration.","image":"https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-007EC7.svg?style=flat-square","latest_version":{"version":"","description":"","commit_hash":"","release_date":0},"versions":[],"tags":[],"author":"oh-my-fish","repository":"https://github.com/oh-my-fish/plugin-gem","license":"MIT","dependencies":[],"stars":0,"forks":4,"watchers":0,"issues":0,"updated":1613331546,"full_description":"![](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-007EC7.svg?style=flat-square)\n\n\u003cdiv align=\"center\"\u003e\n    \u003ca href=\"http://github.com/oh-my-fish/oh-my-fish\"\u003e\n        \u003cimg width=\"90\" src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/8317250/8510172/f006f0a4-230f-11e5-98b6-5c2e3c87088f.png\"\u003e\n    \u003c/a\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nbundler\n=======\n\nRuby gem support for fish.\n\nInstall\n-------\n\n```fish\n$ omf install gem\n```\n\nConfiguration\n-------------\n\nIn order to use `gem` you must specify the path to gem root.

If a `\u003cletter\u003e` or `\u003cword\u003e` ends in `:`, the option is expected to have an argument, which may be supplied separately or next to the option without spaces in the same string.\n\nTo indicate long options: `\u003cletter\u003e:\u003cword\u003e` and `\u003cword\u003e` are both valid option strings that will attempt to match `-\u003cletter\u003e` and `--\u003cword\u003e`.\n\nTo indicate _only_ short options, do not specify a `:\u003cword\u003e` after `\u003cletter\u003e`. For example, `a b` will match `-a` or `-b`.\n\nTo indicate optional arguments, use a `^` character after a `:` at the end of the option in the option string. For example `\u003cletter\u003e:^` and `\u003cletter\u003e:\u003cword\u003e:^` are both valid. Optional arguments should be supplied in the same string as the option and without spaces, e.g, `-\u003cletter\u003evalue` will correctly assign `value` as the argument to the the option `\u003cletter\u003e`, but `-\u003cletter\u003e` value, will parse `value` as the next argument in `\u003cARGV\u003e`.\n\nTo specify optional arguments using the option's long form, use a `=` character after the option: `--\u003cword\u003e=value`.\n\nUse a `:` at the beginning of the option string to enable strict mode. If enabled, `getopts` will exit with a status __\u003e 0__ if or when an unknown option is found. See [Diagnostics](#diagnostics).\n\n#### `\u003cARGV\u003e`\n\nList of options and operands to parse. `getopts` prints any matched options as well as available argument separated by a \\n to stdout and returns with a status of __0__ if there are still arguments; else returns with a status __\u003e 0__ if the end of the options is reached or an error occurs. See [Diagnostics](#diagnostics).\n\n#### Summary\n\n| Option String          |  Argument     | Short Style     | Long Style   |\n|:---------------:|:--------------:|------------------|:--------------------:|\n   `\"q:qqq:\"`          | Required   | `-q1` `-q 1`    | `--qqq 1`           |\n   `\"q:qqq:^\"`         | Optional    | `-q1`              | `--qqq=3`              |\n\n\n## Description\n`getopts` obtains options and their arguments from a list of parameters that, as indicated by \u003coption string\u003e, are single letters preceded by a `-` or words preceded by `--` and possibly followed by an argument value.\n\nfish `getopts` follows the specifications described in the [Utility Syntax Guidelines](http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/7908799/xbd/utilconv.html). The following is a summary of the features:\n\n+ Short options; single letters preceded by `-`, and long options; words preceded by `--`, are both supported.\n\n+ Single letters may be grouped. `-abc` → `-a -b -c`\n\n+ Options required to take an argument can specify the argument either in the same string as the option or separated from the by a space. (1) `-a argument`, (2) `-aargument`\n\n+ Options that can take an argument optionally shall specify the argument in the same string as the option argument if in short option style: `-aargument`, or separated by a `=` if in long form: `--long-form=argument`. If a blank space is used, the following argument will be treated independently.\n\n+ Options can appear multiple times in the same argument list. `getopts` will print every match sequentially on each call, and should default to the short form of the option if available.\n\n+ The option delimiter `:` and optional argument character `^` shall not be used as an option.\n\n+ `getopts` will return the remaining operands when the end of the options is reached, i.e, a `--` argument that is not an option is found, or an argument that does not begin with `-` is found.\n\n## Environment Variables\nThe following environment variables are used internally by `getopts`. These variables are erased from memory when the function returns 1.\n\n+ `__getopts_optstr` _Whitespace trimmed option string._\n\n+ `__getopts_argv` _Preprocessed copy of arguments._\n\n+ `__getopts_index` _Index of the next argument to handle._\n\n+ `__getopts_required` _List of options with required arguments._\n\n+ `__getopts_optional` _List of options with optional arguments._\n\n\n## \u003ca name=\"diagnostics\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003eDiagnostics\nPossible exit status values are:\n\n+ __0__: An argument formed like an option was found. This causes getopts to print the option short-style and its argument if available. If strict-mode is enabled setting the first character of the option to `:`, an unknown option will cause `getopts` to fail. See below.\n\n+ __1__: The end of the options was reached. Remaining operands are also sent to stdout.\n\n+ __2__: An option argument was missing.\n\n+ __3__: An unknown option was found. Only if strict-mode is enabled.\n\n## Examples\n```fish\n  function my_utility\n    while set optarg (getopts \"l:long x: o:optional:^\" $argv)\n      switch $optarg[1]\n        case l\n          echo handle `-l --long`\n        case x\n          echo handle `-x` w/ argument `$optarg[2]`\n        case o\n          echo handle `-o --optional` w/ optional argument `$optarg[2]`\n        case \\*\n          echo unknown option `$optarg[1]`\n      end\n    end\n    echo -n operands: \"`$optarg`\"\n  end\n```\n\n## Links\n+ [UNIX Utility Conventions](http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/7908799/xbd/utilconv.html)\n\n## License\n[MIT](http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT) © [Jorge Bucaran](http://bucaran.me)\n","repository_updated":0},"gh":{"name":"gh","description":"Easily manage your local git repos","image":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jdxcode/gh/master/demo.gif","latest_version":{"version":"","description":"","commit_hash":"","release_date":0},"versions":[],"tags":["bash","cli","fish","github","zsh"],"author":"jdxcode","repository":"https://github.com/jdxcode/gh","license":"ISC","dependencies":[],"stars":159,"forks":36,"watchers":159,"issues":7,"updated":1670260384,"full_description":"gh\n==\n\ngh allows you to very quickly navigate between GitHub project cloned on your\nlocal box. It will `cd` into project directories quickly and clone repos that do\nnot exist.\n\nThere is a lot of mental overhead trying to manage a custom `~/src` directory with your projects. I tried managing by work/personal, programming language, even tried a different directory for each month. I found by simply making your projects path reflect GitHub, it was much easier to remember where things were.\n\nHere is a demo of me moving around various projects\n\n![demo](demo.gif)\n\n\u003c!-- toc --\u003e\n\n- [Usage](#usage)\n  * [Changing the base directory](#changing-the-base-directory)\n- [Supported Shells](#supported-shells)\n- [Installation for bash](#installation-for-bash)\n- [Installation For Fish](#installation-for-fish)\n- [Installation For Oh-My-ZSH](#installation-for-oh-my-zsh)\n- [Installation for zsh](#installation-for-zsh)\n- [GitHub Alternatives](#github-alternatives)\n- [Go developers](#go-developers)\n\n\u003c!-- tocstop --\u003e\n\nUsage\n=====\n\nClone and/or go to `~/src/github.com/githubuser/githubrepo`.\n\n```\ngh githubuser githubrepo\n```\n\nIt'll either just be a `cd` or it will clone `git@github.com:githubuser/githubrepo.git`\n\nNote that tab completion is available for project and usernames.\n\n## Changing the base directory\n`gh` will clone or `cd` into `$GH_BASE_DIR/github.com/user/repo`.\nBy default `$GH_BASE_DIR` points to `$HOME/src`. By changing the `$GH_BASE_DIR` variable in your shell's config file, you can control where `gh` will clone/`cd` into.\n\n**Note:** Already cloned repos will not be transferred to the new location, they will be cloned again.\n\n**More important Note:** Do not use the tilde-character (`~`) in `$GH_BASE_DIR`, use `$HOME` instead.\n\nSupported Shells\n================\n\n* bash\n* [fish](http://fishshell.com/)\n* [OH-MY-ZSH](http://ohmyz.sh/)\n* zsh\n\nInstallation for bash\n=====================\n\n```\necho 'source ~/src/github.com/jdxcode/gh/bash/gh.bash' \u003e\u003e ~/.bashrc\necho 'source ~/src/github.com/jdxcode/gh/completions/gh.bash' \u003e\u003e ~/.bashrc\n```\n\nInstallation For Fish\n=====================\n\nUsing [oh-my-fish](https://github.com/oh-my-fish/oh-my-fish):\n\n```\nomf install gh\n```\n\nUsing [fisherman](https://github.com/fisherman/fisherman):\n\n```\nfisher jdxcode/gh\n```\n\nAlternatively, symlink (or copy) the function and completion files into `$fish_function_path` and `$fish_complete_path`\n\n    mkdir -p ~/src/github.com/jdxcode\n    git clone git@github.com:jdxcode/gh.git ~/src/github.com/jdxcode/gh\n    ln -s ~/src/github.com/jdxcode/gh/functions/gh.fish ~/.config/fish/functions/gh.fish\n    ln -s ~/src/github.com/jdxcode/gh/completions/gh.fish ~/.config/fish/completions/gh.fish\n\nInstallation For Oh-My-ZSH\n==========================\n\nAdd this environment variable for your GitHub username (optional)\n\n    typeset +gx -A GITHUB\n    GITHUB[user]=jdxcode\n\nThen symlink (or copy) the gh folder into your Oh-My-ZSH plugins folder\n\n    ln -s ~/src/github.com/jdxcode/gh/zsh/gh ~/.oh-my-zsh/custom/plugins/gh\n\nNext add the plugin to your `~/.zshrc` file\n\n    plugins=(gh)\n\nFor example:\n\n```\n# Which plugins would you like to load? (plugins can be found in ~/.oh-my-zsh/plugins/*)\n# Custom plugins may be added to ~/.oh-my-zsh/custom/plugins/\n# Example format: plugins=(rails git textmate ruby lighthouse)\nplugins=(git brew meteor node npm osx redis-cli sublime gh)\n\n```\n\nFinally reload the `~/.zshrc` file:\n\n    source ~/.zshrc\n\nThe zsh autocompletion supports loading a user's repositories from github. For that to work, you need to set the environment variable `GH_FETCH_REPOS` to true. You will also need to install [jsawk](https://github.com/micha/jsawk) for it to work.\n\nIf you now type `gh someusername` and then press `\u003cTab\u003e`, it will load that user's repositories from github and display them to you.\n\nNote that, if autocompletion isn't working, then you probably need to make zsh refresh the completions dumpfile. Just remove the `$HOME/.zcompdump-*` file:\n\n    rm $HOME/.zcompdump-*\n\nand reload the `~/.zshrc` again to regenerate it.\n\nFor the `bb` (bitbucket) equivalent, repeat the above instructions, but substitute `gh` with `bb`, i.e.:\n\n    ln -s ~/src/github.com/jdxcode/gh/zsh/bb ~/.oh-my-zsh/custom/plugins/bb\n    plugins=(gh bb)\n    source ~/.zshrc\n\nAs before for `GITHUB` environment variable, the environment variable `BITBUCKET` is optional:\n\n    typeset +gx -A BITBUCKET\n    BITBUCKET[user]=jdxcode\n\n\nInstallation for zsh\n==========================\nZsh supports bash autocomplete. You can add the following to your .zshrc but make sure you have `compinit` done first.\n```\ncompinit\n...\n# bash completion and gh\nautoload bashcompinit\nbashcompinit\nsource ~/src/github.com/jdxcode/gh/bash/gh.bash\nsource ~/src/github.com/jdxcode/gh/completions/gh.bash\n```\n\nGitHub Alternatives\n===================\n\n* bb - bitbucket (fish)\n* gl - gitlab (fish, bash)\n\nGo developers\n=============\n\nThis follows the standard convention for Go projects so long as you have your `GOPATH` set to `~`.\n","repository_updated":0},"ghcup":{"name":"ghcup","description":"","image":"https://www.github.com/oh-my-fish/oh-my-fish","latest_version":{"version":"","description":"","commit_hash":"","release_date":0},"versions":[],"tags":[],"author":"develop7","repository":"https://github.com/develop7/omf-ghcup","license":"MIT","dependencies":[],"stars":0,"forks":0,"watchers":0,"issues":0,"updated":1585997143,"full_description":"\u003cimg src=\"https://cdn.rawgit.com/oh-my-fish/oh-my-fish/e4f1c2e0219a17e2c748b824004c8d0b38055c16/docs/logo.svg\" align=\"left\" width=\"144px\" height=\"144px\"/\u003e\n\n#### [ghcup](ghcup) integration\n\u003e A plugin for [Oh My Fish][omf-link].\n\n[![MIT License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-007EC7.svg?style=flat-square)](/LICENSE)\n[![Fish Shell Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/fish-v2.2.0-007EC7.svg?style=flat-square)](https://fishshell.com)\n[![Oh My Fish Framework](https://img.shields.io/badge/Oh%20My%20Fish-Framework-007EC7.svg?style=flat-square)](https://www.github.com/oh-my-fish/oh-my-fish)\n\n\u003cbr/\u003e\n\n\n## Install\n\n```fish\n$ omf install ghcup\n```\n\n# License\n\n[MIT][mit] © [Andrei Dziahel][author] et [al][contributors]\n\n\n[mit]:            https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT\n[author]:         https://github.com/develop7\n[contributors]:   https://github.com/develop7/plugin-ghcup/graphs/contributors\n[omf-link]:       https://www.github.com/oh-my-fish/oh-my-fish\n[ghcup]:          https://www.haskell.org/ghcup/\n\n[license-badge]:  https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-007EC7.svg?style=flat-square\n","repository_updated":0},"gi":{"name":"gi","description":"gitignore.io CLI for fish.","image":"","latest_version":{"version":"","description":"","commit_hash":"","release_date":0},"versions":[],"tags":[],"author":"oh-my-fish","repository":"https://github.com/oh-my-fish/plugin-gi","license":"MIT","dependencies":[],"stars":10,"forks":13,"watchers":10,"issues":0,"updated":1650741243,"full_description":"gitignore (gi) plugin\n=====================\n\nThis plugin provides a simple command line interface to gitignore.io - a\nwebsite that generates .gitignore files based on your project requirements.\n\n## Completions\n\nThe first step is to download the latest language list from gitignore.io so\nthat the fish completions can be updated.

If there are tools that are\nmissing add them to the executables file and make a pull-request for it\n\nAmong others, it includes the following:\n\n- `cat`\n- `cvs`\n- `df`\n- `diff`\n- `dig`\n- `gcc`\n- `g++`\n- `ifconfig`\n- `ls`\n- `make`\n- `mount`\n- `mtr`\n- `netstat`\n- `ping`\n- `ps`\n- `tail`\n- `traceroute`\n- `wdiff`\n\n## Plugin options\n\nIt's possible to define additional command options via universal `grcplugin`\nvariables. For example:\n\n```fish\nset -U grcplugin_ls --color -l\n```\n\nMakes `grc` call `ls` with `--color` and `-l` options.\n\n### Override command colorizers\n\nIt's possible to override the commands that are colorized via `grc_plugin_execs`\nvariable. For example:\n\n```fish\nset -U grc_plugin_execs gcc g++ make\n```\n\nEnables `grc` colorizing for only `gcc`, `g++` \u0026 `make` and disables all others.\n\n### Ignore specific executables\n\nAlternatively, you can specify commands that the plugin *should not* override.\nYou can do that via the `grc_plugin_ignore_execs` variable:\n\n```fish\nset -U grc_plugin_ignore_execs ls\n```\n\n### Specify custom executables\n\nIf you have custom executables that should be wrapped with `grc` specify them in\n`grc_plugin_extras`:\n\n```fish\nset -U grc_plugin_extras my_custom_executable\n```\n\n# License\n\n[MIT][mit] © [oh-my-fish][author] et [al][contributors]\n\n\n[mit]:            http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT\n[author]:         http://github.com/oh-my-fish\n[contributors]:   https://github.com/oh-my-fish/pkg-plugin-grc/graphs/contributors\n[omf-link]:       https://www.github.com/oh-my-fish/oh-my-fish\n\n[license-badge]:  https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-007EC7.svg?style=flat-square\n[travis-badge]:   http://img.shields.io/travis/oh-my-fish/plugin-grc.svg?style=flat-square\n[travis-link]:    https://travis-ci.org/oh-my-fish/plugin-grc\n[grc]: http://kassiopeia.juls.savba.sk/~garabik/software/grc.html\n[screenshot]: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tannhuber/media/master/grc-plugin.png\n\n\n","repository_updated":0},"hash":{"name":"hash","description":"Computes string digests using various hashing algorithms","image":"","latest_version":{"version":"","description":"","commit_hash":"","release_date":0},"versions":[],"tags":[],"author":"oh-my-fish","repository":"https://github.com/oh-my-fish/plugin-hash","license":"MIT","dependencies":[],"stars":6,"forks":0,"watchers":6,"issues":0,"updated":1666378197,"full_description":"![][license-badge]\n\n# hash\nPlugin for [Oh My Fish][omf].\n\nComputes string digests using various hashing algorithms.\n\n## Install\n```fish\n$ omf install hash\n```\n\n## Usage\nThe `hash` function does just one simple thing: it takes an algorithm and a string, computes the string's hash with the given algorithm, and prints out the result. The string to digest can be provided either as an argument, or piped in from standard input:\n\n```fish\n# command line argument...\n$ hash md5 \"Hello World!\"\n# ...or piped\n$ cat myfile.txt | hash md5\n```\n\nThe available algorithms depend on what utilities you have installed on your system. If you have GNU coreutils installed, any of the algorithms that have an `\u003calgorithm\u003esum` command will be available. On BSD, the core digest commands provide the `md5`, `sha1`, `sha256`, `sha512`, and `rmd160` algorithms. Finally, if OpenSSL is installed, any algorithm installed for OpenSSL will also be available. To see if a given algorithm is available, you can run\n\n```fish\n$ hash -q \u003calgorithm\u003e\n```\n\n## License\n[MIT][mit] © [coderstephen][author] et [al][contributors]\n\n\n[mit]:            http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT\n[author]:         http://github.com/coderstephen\n[contributors]:   https://github.com/oh-my-fish/plugin-hash/graphs/contributors\n[omf]:            https://www.github.com/oh-my-fish/oh-my-fish\n[license-badge]:  https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-007EC7.svg?style=flat-square\n","repository_updated":0},"home-binpath":{"name":"home-binpath","description":"Plugin for Oh My Fish, add ~/.bin to your path","image":"https://www.github.com/oh-my-fish/oh-my-fish","latest_version":{"version":"","description":"","commit_hash":"","release_date":0},"versions":[],"tags":[],"author":"iamruinous","repository":"https://github.com/iamruinous/plugin-home-binpath","license":"MIT","dependencies":[],"stars":0,"forks":0,"watchers":0,"issues":0,"updated":1500662887,"full_description":"\u003cimg src=\"https://cdn.rawgit.com/oh-my-fish/oh-my-fish/e4f1c2e0219a17e2c748b824004c8d0b38055c16/docs/logo.svg\" align=\"left\" width=\"144px\" height=\"144px\"/\u003e\n\n#### envious\n\u003e A plugin for [Oh My Fish][omf-link].

Marlin provides quick access to your most frequently and recently used directories from right in your [Fish] shell.\n\nMarlin is similar in design to popular scripts like [fasd], [z], and [autojump], but is designed to take advantage of the unique features of Fish to provide an even more powerful tool. It is also designed to have a simpler implementation to provide the best performance and not lag your shell.\n\nHere is a list of key features:\n\n- **Lightweight on resources**: Marlin only runs when you change directories or try to complete a path; it does not have pre-exec or post-exec hooks.\n- **Path expansion for any command**: Paths can be searched and expanded in any command, not just `cd`.\n- **Frequent and recent paths**: Results are ordered based on both the frequency you visit a directory and how recently you visited it.\n- **Interactive searching**: If more than one result matches an expansion, you can interactively choose a directory using an interactive filter tool like [fzf], [selecta], or [peco].\n\n## Install\nInstall with [Oh My Fish][omf]:\n\n```fish\n$ omf install marlin\n```\n\nThat's it, Marlin is ready to go!\n\n## Usage\nMarlin learns the directories you frequent while you navigate the filesystem. After `cd`ing around a few times, you can recall those directories using _comma expansion_, Marlin's way of substituting queries with a path. A comma expansion has the following form:\n\n    ,query1,query2,query3,...\n\nEach query is a case-insensitive regular expression that is applied to your directory history and filter only matching directories. To execute the expansion, just press the \u003ckbd\u003eTAB\u003c/kbd\u003e key and the query will be replaced dynamically with the matching result. You can continue to press \u003ckbd\u003eTAB\u003c/kbd\u003e to switch through all of the matching results in order of relevancy.\n\nIf you have an interactive filter tool installed like [fzf], [selecta], or [peco], you can use one of those tools to page through multiple results instead. The popular tools will be used automatically if installed. To use a specific tool, set the `$FILTER` environment variable to the command desired. You can also disable interactive filtering by setting `$FILTER` to be empty:\n\n```fish\nset -g FILTER\n```\n\n## Importing history\nYou can import your history from fasd by running the `marlin:import-fasd` command.\n\n## License\n[MIT][mit] © [sagebind][author] et [al][contributors]\n\n\n[author]: http://github.com/sagebind\n[autojump]: https://github.com/wting/autojump\n[contributors]: https://github.com/oh-my-fish/plugin-fasd/graphs/contributors\n[fasd]: https://github.com/clvv/\n[fish]: http://fishshell.com\n[fzf]: https://github.com/junegunn/fzf\n[mit]: http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT\n[omf]: https://www.github.com/oh-my-fish/oh-my-fish\n[peco]: https://github.com/peco/peco\n[selecta]: https://github.com/garybernhardt/selecta\n[z]: https://github.com/rupa/z\n","repository_updated":0},"mix":{"name":"mix","description":"","image":"","latest_version":{"version":"","description":"","commit_hash":"","release_date":0},"versions":[],"tags":[],"author":"belltoy","repository":"https://github.com/belltoy/plugin-mix","license":"MIT","dependencies":[],"stars":0,"forks":1,"watchers":0,"issues":0,"updated":1631699545,"full_description":"![][license-badge]\n\n\u003cdiv align=\"center\"\u003e\n  \u003ca href=\"http://github.com/oh-my-fish/oh-my-fish\"\u003e\n  \u003cimg width=90px  src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/8317250/8510172/f006f0a4-230f-11e5-98b6-5c2e3c87088f.png\"\u003e\n  \u003c/a\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n# mix\n\nPlugin for [Oh My Fish][omf-link].\n\n## Install\n\n```fish\n$ omf install mix\n```\n\n\n## Usage\n\n```fish\n$ mix\n```\n\n# License\n\n[MIT][mit] © [belltoy][author] et [al][contributors]\n\n\n[mit]:            http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT\n[author]:         http://github.com/belltoy\n[contributors]:   https://github.com/belltoy/omf-pkg-mix/graphs/contributors\n[omf-link]:       https://www.github.com/oh-my-fish/oh-my-fish\n\n[license-badge]:  https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-007EC7.svg?style=flat-square\n","repository_updated":0},"mou":{"name":"mou","description":"Use Mou.app from command line.","image":"http://25.io/mou/img/mou_512x512.png","latest_version":{"version":"","description":"","commit_hash":"","release_date":0},"versions":[],"tags":[],"author":"oh-my-fish","repository":"https://github.com/oh-my-fish/plugin-mou","license":"MIT","dependencies":[],"stars":0,"forks":2,"watchers":0,"issues":1,"updated":1613331566,"full_description":"\u003cimg src=\"http://25.io/mou/img/mou_512x512.png\" align=\"left\" width=\"144px\" height=\"144px\"/\u003e\n\n#### mou\n\u003e Use Mou.app from command line.\n\n[![MIT License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-007EC7.svg?style=flat-square)](/LICENSE)\n[![Fish Shell Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/fish-v2.2.0-007EC7.svg?style=flat-square)](https://fishshell.com)\n[![Oh My Fish Framework](https://img.shields.io/badge/Oh%20My%20Fish-Framework-007EC7.svg?style=flat-square)](https://www.github.com/oh-my-fish/oh-my-fish)\n\n\u003cbr/\u003e\n\n\n## Install\n\n```fish\n$ omf install mou\n```\n\n\n## Usage\n\n\nOpen Markdown files with Mou\n\n```fish\n$ mou README.md\n```\n\nOr just open Mou without opening files\n\n```fish\n$ mou\n```\n\n\n# License\n\n[MIT][mit] © [Derek W.

`flushdns` - Flushes the DNS cache for Yosemite and El Capitan\n- `itunes` - Control iTunes: Play, pause, stop, resume, etc.\n- `manp` - Open a specified man page in Preview\n- `pfd` - Return the path of the frontmost Finder window\n- `pfs` - Return the current Finder selection\n- `pushdf` - `pushd` to the current Finder directory\n- `ql` - Quick Look a specified file or directory\n- `showhidden` - Shows hidden files and folders in Finder\n- `trash` - Move a specified file to the Trash\n- `unset` - Emulates the `unset` command to unset an environment variable\n- `updatedb` - Updates locate command database\n\n\u003e *Note*: the `tab` function was dropped in favor a more robust [plugin-tab].\n\n\n## Install\n\n```fish\n$ omf install osx\n```\n\n\n## Usage\n\n```fish\n$ itunes -h  # show

It can be your `Documents`,\nit can be your home directory. Sometimes you have multiple directories,\nlike work, personal, college, etc.\n\nFinding a project is easy when you have a few projects and a central\ndirectory, but when any of projects or directories grows a lot, it gets\nreally difficult to find stuff you just wanted to work on.\n\nHere comes `prj`, a quick project jump tool based on a global path\nvariable: Project directories are present in `$project_path`.\n\nThis path variable can be enhanced the way you like with globbing tricks\nor even more complex setups that can be made on your init file.\n\n## So...

If you'd like to learn more about\nthe use of these variables, this [Arch Wiki Article][archwiki-article] is a\ngood place to start.\n\n[macports]:         http://www.macports.org/\n[homebrew]:         http://brew.sh/\n[archwiki-article]: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/proxy_settings\n\n\n## Install\n\n```fish\n$ omf install proxy\n```\n\n\n## Usage\n\n### No authentication\n\nIf you just want to have the proxy plugin configure all the environment\nvariables, you may set proxy_host and proxy_auth in\n`$OMF_CONFIG/before.init.fish`:\n\n```fish\nset proxy_host myproxy.example.com:8000\nset proxy_auth false\n```\n\nThe proxy plugin will prepend `http://` for you.  Here's the result:\n\n    ~\u003e set -x |grep proxy\n    ALL_PROXY http://myproxy.example.com:8000\n    FTP_PROXY http://myproxy.example.com:8000\n    HTTPS_PROXY http://myproxy.example.com:8000\n    HTTP_PROXY http://myproxy.example.com:8000\n    all_proxy http://myproxy.example.com:8000\n    ftp_proxy http://myproxy.example.com:8000\n    http_proxy http://myproxy.example.com:8000\n    https_proxy http://myproxy.example.com:8000\n\n### With authentication\n\nSet your proxy host and username in `$OMF_CONFIG/before.init.fish`:\n\n```fish\nset proxy_host myproxy.example.com:8000\nset proxy_auth true\nset proxy_user mylogin\n```\n\nWhen you need to make use of the proxy, just run `proxy`.  It will prompt you\nfor a password and setup your environment.\n\nIf you didn't setup a proxy_user variable, you will be prompted for a username.\n\nIf you wish to clear your proxy variables, run `noproxy`.\n\n\n# License\n\n[MIT][mit] © [oh-my-fish][author] et [al][contributors]\n\n[mit]:            http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT\n[author]:         http://github.com/oh-my-fish\n[contributors]:   https://github.com/oh-my-fish/plugin-proxy/graphs/contributors\n[omf-link]:       https://www.github.com/oh-my-fish/oh-my-fish\n\n[license-badge]:  https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-007EC7.svg?style=flat-square\n","repository_updated":0},"publish":{"name":"publish","description":"Publish the contents of the clipboard, or a file, or several, in its entirety or partially.","image":"","latest_version":{"version":"","description":"","commit_hash":"","release_date":0},"versions":null,"tags":["clipboard","fish","pastebin","plugin","shell"],"author":"Lusiadas","repository":"https://gitlab.com/lusiadas/publish","license":"Unknown","dependencies":null,"stars":0,"forks":0,"watchers":0,"issues":0,"updated":0,"full_description":"","repository_updated":0},"pyenv":{"name":"pyenv","description":"Simple Python Version Management integration.","image":"https://www.github.com/oh-my-fish/oh-my-fish","latest_version":{"version":"","description":"","commit_hash":"","release_date":0},"versions":[],"tags":[],"author":"oh-my-fish","repository":"https://github.com/oh-my-fish/plugin-pyenv","license":"MIT","dependencies":[],"stars":30,"forks":10,"watchers":30,"issues":3,"updated":1671281387,"full_description":"\u003cimg src=\"https://cdn.rawgit.com/oh-my-fish/oh-my-fish/e4f1c2e0219a17e2c748b824004c8d0b38055c16/docs/logo.svg\" align=\"left\" width=\"144px\" height=\"144px\"/\u003e\n\n# Pyenv Plugin for Fish Shell\n\n[![MIT License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-007EC7.svg?style=flat-square)](/LICENSE)\n[![Fish Shell Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/fish-v2.2.0-007EC7.svg?style=flat-square)](http://fishshell.com)\n[![Oh My Fish Framework](https://img.shields.io/badge/Oh%20My%20Fish-Framework-007EC7.svg?style=flat-square)](https://www.github.com/oh-my-fish/oh-my-fish)\n\n\u003cbr/\u003e\n\nUse [Pyenv][pyenv] with [fish shell][fish-shell] managed by [Oh my\nfish][omf-link] in a very simple way!\n\n## Installation\n\n```fish\nomf update  # Just in case omf is outdated.

Custom bindings can also be defined that begin with an escape character.\n\u003e\n\u003e Holding alt and something else also typically sends escape, for example holding alt+a will send an escape character and then an \"a\".\n\u003e\n\u003e fish waits for a period after receiving the escape character, to determine whether it is standalone or part of an escape sequence. While waiting, additional key presses make the escape key behave as a meta key.\n\u003e If no other key presses come in, it is handled as a standalone escape. The waiting period is set to 30 milliseconds (0.03 seconds).\n\u003e It can be configured by setting the `fish_escape_delay_ms` variable to a value between 10 and 5000 ms.\n\u003e This can be a universal variable that you set once from an interactive session.\n\u003e\n\u003e Note: fish 2.2.0 and earlier used a default of 10 milliseconds, and provided no way to configure it. That effectively made it impossible to use escape as a meta key.\n\n(from https://fishshell.com/docs/3.1/cmds/bind.html#special-case-the-escape-character)\n\nIn other words, using \u003ckbd\u003eEsc\u003c/kbd\u003e+\u003ckbd\u003eEsc\u003c/kbd\u003e is possible with fish 2.3+, but you might need to tweak `fish_escape_delay_ms` to more than 30ms if you're using fish 3.1+ and having trouble activating sudope reliably.\n\n#### License\n\n2015-2020 [ISC] @ [Itzik Ephraim]\nCommits e45d168 and 0928ab2: 2017 [ISC] @ [Chloe Kudryavtsev]\n\n[sudo plugin]: https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/tree/master/plugins/sudo\n[Oh-My-Fish]: https://github.com/oh-my-fish/oh-my-fish\n[ISC]: http://cvsweb.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb/src/share/misc/license.template?rev=HEAD\n[Itzik Ephraim]: https://github.com/oranja\n[Chloe Kudryavtsev]: https://github.com/5paceToast\n","repository_updated":0},"tab":{"name":"tab","description":"Open the current directory (or any other directory) in a new tab.","image":"https://www.github.com/oh-my-fish/oh-my-fish","latest_version":{"version":"","description":"","commit_hash":"","release_date":0},"versions":[],"tags":[],"author":"oh-my-fish","repository":"https://github.com/oh-my-fish/plugin-tab","license":"MIT","dependencies":[],"stars":31,"forks":11,"watchers":31,"issues":5,"updated":1666974704,"full_description":"\u003cimg src=\"https://cdn.rawgit.com/oh-my-fish/oh-my-fish/e4f1c2e0219a17e2c748b824004c8d0b38055c16/docs/logo.svg\" align=\"left\" width=\"144px\" height=\"144px\"/\u003e\n\n#### tab\n\u003e A super-rad plugin for [Oh My Fish][omf-link].\n\n[![MIT License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-007EC7.svg?style=flat-square)](/LICENSE)\n[![Fish Shell Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/fish-v2.2.0-007EC7.svg?style=flat-square)](http://fishshell.com)\n[![Oh My Fish Framework](https://img.shields.io/badge/Oh%20My%20Fish-Framework-007EC7.svg?style=flat-square)](https://www.github.com/oh-my-fish/oh-my-fish)\n\n\u003cbr/\u003e\n\nOpen new iTerm, Apple Terminal, Konsole, Gnome Terminal and Guake tabs from the command line.\n\n\n## Install\n\n```fish\n$ omf install tab\n```\n\nIf you use iTerm and your default session profile isn't \"Default Session\" you can override it in your omf `init.fish`:\n\n```fish\nset -g tab_iterm_profile \"MyProfile\"\n```\n\n\n## Usage\n\n```fish\n$ tab                     Opens the current directory in a new tab\n$ tab [path]              Open PATH in a new tab\n$ tab [cmd]               Open a new tab and execute CMD\n$ tab [path] [cmd] ...

All public DSL functions are ended by `:`.\n\n### Colorisation\n\nYou can make text coloured using `tint:`.\n\n```fish\ntint: red 'The London bridge is falling down!'\ntint: 555 'The London bridge is falling down!'\necho (tint: red 'Error!') 'Something went wrong!'\n```\n\nSet a background color using `bg:`\n\n```fish\nbg: blue 'Violets are blue'\nbg: 400 'Want some wine, sir?'\n```\n\nUse both via command substitution!\n\n```fish\nbg: red (tint: white 'You better read this text!')\ntint: white (bg: red 'You better read this text!')\n```\n\n### Stylization\n\nMake text `bold:`\n\n```fish\nbold: 'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog'\n```\n\nOutput text verbatim, without _adding_ newlines or trailing spaces using `inline:`\n\n```fish\nfunction oompa\n  inline: 'Oompa Loompa '\n  inline: 'doom-pa-dee-do '\n  inline: 'I have another '\n  inline: 'puzzle for you'\nend\n```\n\nSometimes you want to wrap text in a specific column. Use `wrap:`\n\n```fish\nfunction lorem\n  wrap: 80 'Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur' \\\n           'adipiscing elit. Nulla in purus quis erat' \\\n           'aliquet tristique eget et risus. Pellentesque' \\\n           'eget leo id urna dignissim elementum quis ut' \\\n           'libero. Vivamus interdum at nunc sagittis cursus.'\nend\n```\n\n## What Technicolor fixes\n\nFish shell provides the builtin function `set_color`, which abstracts terminal text colorization in a _orthogonal_ function.\n\nNote that even using this abstraction, shell colors still continue to be __stateful__, so once you switch to a color you need to reset the changes manually. This fact makes producing beautiful CLIs a true nightmare:\n\n```fish\nfunction explode\n  set_color --bold red\n  printf \"Error: \"\n  set_color normal\n  set_color red\n  echo \"You can't explode\"\n  set_color normal\nend\n```\n\nUsing Technicolor it's possible to transform the above function into the one below:\n\n```fish\nfunction explode\n  echo (tint: red (bold: 'Error:')) (tint: red 'You can\\'t explode')\nend\n```\n\n# License\n\n[MIT][mit] © [Derek Stavis][author] et [al][contributors]\n\n\n[mit]:            http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT\n[author]:         http://github.com/derekstavis\n[contributors]:   https://github.com/derekstavis/plugin-technicolor/graphs/contributors\n[omf-link]:       https://www.github.com/oh-my-fish/oh-my-fish\n\n[license-badge]:  https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-007EC7.svg?style=flat-square\n[travis-badge]:   http://img.shields.io/travis/derekstavis/technicolor.svg?style=flat-square\n[travis-link]:    https://travis-ci.org/derekstavis/technicolor\n","repository_updated":0},"thefuck":{"name":"thefuck","description":"⚡️ Provide fast and painless support to TheFuck ","image":"","latest_version":{"version":"","description":"","commit_hash":"","release_date":0},"versions":[],"tags":["fish","oh-my-fish","thefuck"],"author":"oh-my-fish","repository":"https://github.com/oh-my-fish/plugin-thefuck","license":"MIT","dependencies":[],"stars":61,"forks":5,"watchers":61,"issues":6,"updated":1671313951,"full_description":"[![][travis-badge]][travis-link]\n![][license-badge]\n\n\u003cdiv align=\"center\"\u003e\n  \u003ca href=\"http://github.com/oh-my-fish/oh-my-fish\"\u003e\n  \u003cimg width=90px  src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/8317250/8510172/f006f0a4-230f-11e5-98b6-5c2e3c87088f.png\"\u003e\n  \u003c/a\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\n# thefuck\n\nThis plug-in creates the necessary function to be used with [The Fuck][thefuck].\nIt brings:\n\n* Fast initialization (benchmark: diff is 10ms, median)\n* Lazy auto-update (only when The Fuck gets updated)\n* Key binding for command line replacement\n\n\n## Install\n\nAfter [installing The Fuck][thefuck-install], proceed:\n\n```fish\n$ omf install thefuck\n```\n\n\n## Optional key binding\n\nTo use a key bind just add it to your `fish_user_key_bindings` function:\n\n```fish\nfunction fish_user_key_bindings\n  # ...\n  bind \\e\\e 'thefuck-command-line'  # Bind EscEsc to thefuck\n  # ...\nend\n```\n\n\n## Usage\n\n```fish\n$ git brch\n$ fuck\n```\n\n\n# License\n\n[MIT][mit] © [scorphus][author] et [al][contributors]\n\n[thefuck]:         https://github.com/nvbn/thefuck\n[thefuck-install]: https://github.com/nvbn/thefuck/#requirements\n\n[mit]:             http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT\n[author]:          https://github.com/scorphus\n[contributors]:    https://github.com/oh-my-fish/plugin-thefuck/graphs/contributors\n[omf-link]:        https://www.github.com/oh-my-fish/oh-my-fish\n\n[license-badge]:   https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-007EC7.svg?style=flat-square\n[travis-badge]:    http://img.shields.io/travis/oh-my-fish/plugin-thefuck.svg?style=flat-square\n[travis-link]:     https://travis-ci.org/oh-my-fish/plugin-thefuck\n","repository_updated":0},"tiny":{"name":"tiny","description":"tap into github's git.io URL shortener.","image":"","latest_version":{"version":"","description":"","commit_hash":"","release_date":0},"versions":[],"tags":[],"author":"oh-my-fish","repository":"https://github.com/oh-my-fish/plugin-tiny","license":"MIT","dependencies":[],"stars":2,"forks":1,"watchers":2,"issues":0,"updated":1666974753,"full_description":"# _tiny_\n\u003e git.io for the lazy\n\n## Synopsis\n\n```\ntiny [-u --user \u003cusername\u003e]\n     [-r --repo \u003crepository\u003e]\n     [-c --code \u003cvanity code\u003e]\n     [-o --open]\n     [-h --help]\n\ntiny [-c --code] [-o --open] owned-repo/url\n```\n\n## Description\nTap into [git.io](http://git.io), github's URL shortener service, to easily _shorten_ any github URL.

Otherwise, you can download and compile tmux yourself:\n\n```fish\n$ wget https://github.com/tmux/tmux/releases/download/2.0/tmux-2.0.tar.gz\n$ tar xcf tmux-2.0.tar.gz; and cd tmux-2.0\n$ ./configure; and make\n$ sudo make install\n```\n\nNow you can install tmux zen using [Oh My Fish][omf]:\n\n```fish\n$ omf install tmux-zen\n```\n\nThat's it! Prepare yourself for an epic journey to ultimate terminal zen.\n\n\n## The path to zen\nTmux is a terminal multiplexer geared toward developers and admins who regulary make use of the terminal. Fish (and the Oh My Fish framework) is a friendly interactive shell that is an intuitive alternative to the old and confusing syntax of bash-like shells.\n\nIn tmux zen, tmux allows us to break the concept of terminal sessions out of desktop windows and into a central location. This location is the *session*, which will contain all of our terminal windows that will ever exist. Any time you open a terminal app, you will be presented with a *portal* that allows you to view and access the session. When you desire to create a new shell prompt, you do so by creating a new *window*. A window is similar to a window in a graphical deskop, except that it lives in our zen session.\n\nThis journey assumes basic knowledge on both tmux and fish.\n\n### Managing windows\nFirst, we need to open a portal in order to access our session. We can do this by simply opening a terminal and running `fish`. A portal will be opened, and the terminal will now be connected to the session. By default, the session will be created if it did not already exist. Opening a portal will also create us a new empty window in the session with a fish shell prompt waiting for you. You can use this window like any other terminal window.\n\nWhen we are using an open portal, we can interact with our session windows just like normal tmux windows and panes. To create a new window, you can use `Prefix+c`. The view will switch to a new window, while keeping our old window still open. If we run `exit`, only the current window will be closed.\n\n### More on portals\nIn tmux zen, portals are cheap. If you close your terminal app, you might normally expect your shell session to be forcefully closed. When you close a portal however, all of your windows in the session remain in existence. To access them again, simply open up another portal.\n\nThe workflow becomes even closer to zen when using multiple portals. Go ahead and try to open two, three, or more portals. You will notice that all of the portals provide a view into our same session each time, but each can view a different window or the same window. This allows us to select whatever windows we need to access simultaneously by using multiple portals and switching to the desired window in each.\n\n### Preparing our workspace\nIt can be very helpful to run some commands each time the session is created for the first time. This could be startup scripts, or scripts that open certain programs in certain windows. We can set these commands by creating a fish function that listens for the `zen.init` [event]. Tmux zen will trigger this event once, when the session is first created. For example, here's a script that will open Vim in its own window:\n\n```fish\nfunction my-zen-init --on-event zen.init\n    zen tmux new-window vim\nend\n```\n\nAdd this to your `config.fish` (or in some other setup script) and next time we start our session, a Vim window will be created for us.\n\n\n## Configuration\nTmux zen has a few configuration options that you can customize:\n\n- `session-name`: The name to use for the shared tmux session.\n- `tmux-bin`: Specify a specific tmux binary to execute tmux commands with.\n- `events.init`: A Fish script to also run on the `zen.init` event.\n\nSee `zen config --help` for help on how to modify these settings.\n\n\n## Need some guidance?\nThis journey isn't meant to be a solo experience. Feel free to ask me [@sagebind](http://twitter.com/sagebind) or any other tmux guru for guidance.\n\n\n## License\n[MIT][mit] © [Stephen Coakley][author] et [al][contributors]\n\n\n[mit]:            http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT\n[author]:         http://github.com/sagebind\n[contributors]:   https://github.com/sagebind/tmux-zen/graphs/contributors\n[omf]:            https://github.com/oh-my-fish/oh-my-fish\n[event]:          http://fishshell.com/docs/current/index.html#event\n[tmux]:           https://tmux.github.io\n[license-badge]:  https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-007EC7.svg?style=flat-square\n","repository_updated":0},"touchrunner":{"name":"touchrunner","description":"Run npm scripts from the MacBook Pro Touch Bar","image":"https://www.github.com/oh-my-fish/oh-my-fish","latest_version":{"version":"","description":"","commit_hash":"","release_date":0},"versions":[],"tags":["fishshell","npm","ohmyfish","scripts","touchbar"],"author":"derekstavis","repository":"https://github.com/derekstavis/touchrunner","license":"MIT","dependencies":[],"stars":47,"forks":2,"watchers":47,"issues":1,"updated":1654979107,"full_description":"\u003cimg src=\"https://cdn.rawgit.com/oh-my-fish/oh-my-fish/e4f1c2e0219a17e2c748b824004c8d0b38055c16/docs/logo.svg\" align=\"left\" width=\"144px\" height=\"144px\"/\u003e\n\n#### touchrunner\n\u003e Run tasks from the touchbar\n\n[![MIT License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-007EC7.svg?style=flat-square)](/LICENSE)\n[![Fish Shell Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/fish-v2.2.0-007EC7.svg?style=flat-square)](https://fishshell.com)\n[![Oh My Fish Framework](https://img.shields.io/badge/Oh%20My%20Fish-Framework-007EC7.svg?style=flat-square)](https://www.github.com/oh-my-fish/oh-my-fish)\n\n\u003cbr/\u003e\n\n\n## Installing\n\n```fish\n$ omf install touchrunner\n```\n\n## What will you get\n\n![Touchrunner demo](touchrunner.gif \"Touchrunner demo\")\n\n## Requirements\n\n1.

Once you have oh-my-fish set up, just run:\n\n```\nomf install vish\n```\n\n## Demo\n\n![Demo Animation](../readme/demo.gif?raw=true)\n\n## Configuration\n\n* Set the following variables in your config.fish, before omf hooks:\n  * `_VISH_ESCAPE` to the terminal sequence you want to be your \"leader\" key. By default it's set to `\\e'`.\n  * `VISH_FEATURES` (array) to the set of features you want. Default is `dirs prefices prompt misc`, add `tmux` if you use it.\n  * If you use tmux, set `_VISH_PROMPT_MAGIC_CHAR` to a character that only appears in your prompt. This helps some keybindings identify your prompt in tmux panes.\n\n## Usage\n\nVish uses modal key sequences, kind of like vim does. All sequences start with the leader key `\u003cL\u003e`, then use some sequence of register names and commands, usually `\u003cregister\u003e\u003ccommand\u003e`. For example, `\u003cL\u003e\u003cL\u003eh` calls `history --merge`, while `\u003cL\u003eam` saves current directory to register a. Here's a few sequences I commonly use:\n\n* `\u003cL\u003eam` saves current directory to register a. `\u003cL\u003eag` goes to directory under register a. `\u003cL\u003e=m` lists all saved directories.\n* `\u003cL\u003e*p` saves current commandline contents to selection buffer.\n* `\u003cL\u003e*a` appends selection buffer to commandline.\n* With tmux, `\u003cL\u003e-1la` appends last line of command output to commandline.\n\nTo list all configured bindings with brief descriptions, run `vish_help`.\n\n### Registers\n\nVish defines registers from a to z, plus some special registers. Unlike vim, there can be multiple sets of registers a-z, e.g. one for directories, one for commands etc, with each keybinding implicitly using one of them. Registers are **UNIVERSAL** and are shared between all shells. Special registers are shared by all keybindings, and by default are as follows:\n\n* `0` is the \"implicit\" register.\n* `*` and `+` are equivalents of vim clipboard registers. For convenience they're also mapped under `,` and `.`, respectively.\n* Additionally, `\u003cL\u003ea*` and `\u003cL\u003ea+` bindings copy register 'a' to the clipboard register.\n\nEach register set is bound to a letter. For a set bound to a letter `\u003cx\u003e`, `\u003cL\u003ea\u003cx\u003e` sets register a, `\u003cL\u003ea-\u003cx\u003e` clears it and `\u003cL\u003e=\u003cx\u003e` lists all letters in a set.\n\n### Feature: directories\n\nEnabled by `dirs` in `VISH_FEATURES`. Defines a \"dirs\" register set under letter m.\n\n- `\u003cL\u003eam` saves current directory to register a.\n- `\u003cL\u003eag` goes to directory under register a. Try `\u003cL\u003e*g` for going to directory saved to clipboard.\n\n### Feature: commands\n\nEnabled by `prefices` in `VISH_FEATURES`. Defines a \"prefices\" register set under letter p.\n\n- `\u003cL\u003eap` to save current commandline to register a.\n- `\u003cL\u003eaa` to append contents of register a to commandline.\n- `\u003cL\u003eax` to execute contents of register a.\n- `\u003cL\u003eaz` to prepend contents of register a at every prompt, `\u003cL\u003eaz` again to turn it off.\n\n### Feature: misc bindings\n\nEnabled by `misc` in `VISH_FEATURES`.\n\n- `\u003cL\u003e\u003cL\u003eh` calls `history --merge`.\n\n### Feature: prompt\n\nEnabled by `prompt` in `VISH_FEATURES`.\n\nFor `fish_prompt`:\n- `_vish_prompt_path` prints current directory in short or long format. `\u003cL\u003e\u003cL\u003es` toggles the format.\n\nFor `fish_right_prompt`:\n- `_vish_right_prompt_git_branch` prints current git branch. `\u003cL\u003e\u003cL\u003eg` toogles it on or off.\n- `_vish_right_prompt_status` prints return code of last command.\n- `_vish_right_prompt_states` prints useful status info. At the moments it prints `j` if there are background jobs and `I` if ping mode is enabled.\n\nEach right prompt function can be toggled by calling `_vish_prompt_toggle GIT_BRANCH/PING/SHORT_PATH`, e.g. in your config.fish.\n\n`\u003cL\u003e\u003cL\u003ei` toogles ping mode on and off.\n- When ping mode is on, fish will run a `_vish_ping` function, if defined, after long-running commands. It's up to you to define `_vish_ping`.\n- Any command that matches a regex in `$VISH_INTERACTIVE_CMDS` array will be considered interactive and `_vish_ping` won't be called.\n- By default any command that runs 10 seconds or longer is long-running. You can change that nubmer by defining `$VISH_COMMAND_PING_MIN_TIME`.\n\n### Feature: tmux\n\nEnabled by `tmux` in `VISH_FEATURES`.\n\n- `\u003cL\u003et\u003cx\u003e` for various tmux shortcuts, see `vish_help`. In particular `\u003cL\u003ett` autocompletes word under cursor, searching in current window's panes.\n- `\u003cL\u003e\u003cN\u003el` to copy lines from last command's output to register 0, then wait for another keybinding.

By default, both Celsius and Fahrenheit is displayed for the temperature. You can override this by specifying a particular unit to use in `$temperature_units`. Valid options are:\n\n- `celsius`\n- `fahrenheit`\n- `kelvin`\n\nYou can see the results by changing the value and running `weather` again:\n\n```fish\n$ config weather -s temperature-units celsius\n$ weather\nTemperature: 14.37 °C\n   Humidity: 58%\n Cloudiness: sky is clear\n   Pressure: 1029 hpa\n       Wind: from NE (60°) at 7.2 m/s gusting to 10.8 m/s\n```\n\nYou can set this permanently by adding the `config weather -s temperature-units` command in your `.config/omf/init.fish` file:\n```fish\nconfig weather -s temperature-units \u003c celsius | fahrenheit | kelvin \u003e\n```\n\n\nYou can also configure the weather command to use the system default DNS resolver to fetch your IP address if one is configured.\n\n```fish\n$ set -g __weather_system_dns 1\n```\n\n\n# License\n\n[MIT][mit] © [coderstephen][author] et [al][contributors]\n\n\n[mit]:            http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT\n[author]:         http://github.com/coderstephen\n[contributors]:   https://github.com/oh-my-fish/plugin-weather/graphs/contributors\n[omf-link]:       https://www.github.com/oh-my-fish/oh-my-fish\n[license-badge]:  https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-007EC7.svg?style=flat-square\n","repository_updated":0},"wifi-password":{"name":"wifi-password","description":"","image":"","latest_version":{"version":"","description":"","commit_hash":"","release_date":0},"versions":[],"tags":[],"author":"oh-my-fish","repository":"https://github.com/oh-my-fish/plugin-wifi-password","license":"MIT","dependencies":[],"stars":5,"forks":2,"watchers":5,"issues":1,"updated":1653377571,"full_description":"# wifi-password\n\nGet your wifi's password in Fish Shell\n\n## Install\n\n```fish\n$ omf install wifi-password\n```\n\n## Usage\n\n```fish\n$ wifi-password\n```\n\n## Contributing\n\n1.

It tracks your most used directories, based on 'frecency'.  After  a  short  learning  phase, z will take you to the most 'frecent' directory that matches ALL of the regexes given on the command line, in order.\r\n\r\nFor example, `z foo bar` would match `/foo/bar` but not `/bar/foo`.\r\n\r\n## Reputation\r\n\r\nFrom people using z.lua:\r\n\r\n- I like this in principal. I’m pretty damn predictable at the command line and far too lazy to make shortcuts\r\n- It feels far more intuitive and it's so incredibly convenient to be able to jump between folders I'm working in without having to traverse an entire tree. The shell used to feel so constraining for me, but tools like this are making me enjoy it so much more. \r\n- I can finally have autojump-like functionality on my Raspberry Pi 1 without waiting 30 seconds every time I open a new shell. Thanks z.lua devs.\r\n- Anyway, z.lua is a promising project. If you only need directory jumping, it may be the best choice.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Features\r\n\r\n- **10x** times faster than **fasd** and **autojump**, **3x** times faster than **z.sh**.\r\n- Gain the ultimate speed with an optional [native module](https://github.com/skywind3000/czmod) written in C.\r\n- Available for **posix shells**: bash, zsh, dash, sh, ash, ksh, busybox and etc.\r\n- Available for Fish Shell, Power Shell and Windows cmd.\r\n- [Enhanced matching algorithm](#enhanced-matching) takes you to where ever you want precisely.\r\n- Allow updating database only if `$PWD` changed with \"$_ZL_ADD_ONCE\" set to 1.\r\n- Interactive selection enables you to choose where to go before cd.\r\n- Integrated with FZF (optional) for interactive selection and completion.\r\n- Quickly go back to a parent directory instead of typing \"cd ../../..\".\r\n- Corresponding experience in different shells and operating systems. \r\n- Compatible with Lua (5.1, 5.2, 5.3+) and luajit.\r\n- Self contained, distributed as a single `z.lua` script, no other dependence.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Examples\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nz foo        # cd to most frecent dir matching foo\r\nz foo bar    # cd to most frecent dir matching foo and bar\r\nz -r foo     # cd to the highest ranked dir matching foo\r\nz -t foo     # cd to most recently accessed dir matching foo\r\nz -l foo     # list matches instead of cd\r\nz -c foo     # restrict matches to subdirs of $PWD\r\nz -e foo     # echo the best match, don't cd\r\nz -i foo     # cd with interactive selection\r\nz -I foo     # cd with interactive selection using fzf\r\nz -b foo     # cd to the parent directory starting with foo\r\nz -b foo bar # replace foo with bar in cwd and cd there\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n## Install\r\n\r\n- Bash:\r\n\r\n  put something like this in your `.bashrc`:\r\n\r\n      eval \"$(lua /path/to/z.lua --init bash)\"\r\n\r\n  the default matching algorithm is similar to z.sh to keep compatible, you may like the enhanced matching algorithm for productivity:\r\n\r\n      eval \"$(lua /path/to/z.lua --init bash enhanced once)\"\r\n\r\n  and perhaps this:\r\n\r\n      eval \"$(lua /path/to/z.lua --init bash enhanced once echo)\"\r\n\r\n  if you want `z.lua` print the new directory after cd. \r\n\r\n  For `fzf` tab completion use:\r\n\r\n      eval \"$(lua /path/to/z.lua --init bash enhanced once fzf)\"\r\n  \r\n  **NOTE**: For wsl-1 users, `lua-filesystem` must be installed:\r\n\r\n      sudo apt-get install lua-filesystem\r\n\r\n  To avoid a wsl-1 [defect](https://github.com/microsoft/WSL/issues/5505).\r\n\r\n- Zsh:\r\n\r\n  put something like this in your `.zshrc`:\r\n\r\n      eval \"$(lua /path/to/z.lua --init zsh)\"\r\n\r\n  Options like \"enhanced\" and \"once\" can be used after `--init` too. It can also be initialized from \"skywind3000/z.lua\" with your zsh plugin managers (antigen / oh-my-zsh).\r\n\r\n  **NOTE**: for wsl-1 users, `lua-filesystem` must be installed.\r\n\r\n- Posix Shells:\r\n\r\n  put something like this in your `.profile`:\r\n\r\n      eval \"$(lua /path/to/z.lua --init posix)\"\r\n\r\n  For old shells like ksh (Korn Shell), some features are missing, you can try:\r\n\r\n      eval \"$(lua /path/to/z.lua --init posix legacy)\"\r\n\r\n  To generate old posix compatible script.\r\n\r\n- Fish Shell (version `2.4.0` or above):\r\n\r\n  Create `~/.config/fish/conf.d/z.fish` with following code\r\n\r\n      lua /path/to/z.lua --init fish | source\r\n\r\n  If you'd like `z.lua` to cooperate with fish's own [directory history](https://fishshell.com/docs/3.2/index.html#id34), you can put\r\n\r\n      set -gx _ZL_CD cd\r\n\r\n  into the same file.\r\n\r\n- Power Shell:\r\n\r\n  \u003e ⚠️ **WARNING**: users of [Starship Prompt](https://starship.rs/) should add the following command *after* `starship init`.\r\n  \r\n  put something like this in your `profile.ps1`:\r\n\r\n      Invoke-Expression (\u0026 { (lua /path/to/z.lua --init powershell) -join \"`n\" })\r\n\r\n- Windows cmd (with clink):\r\n\r\n  - Copy z.lua and z.cmd to clink's home directory\r\n  - Add clink's home to `%PATH%` (z.cmd can be called anywhere)\r\n  - Ensure that \"lua\" can be called in `%PATH%`\r\n\r\n- Windows cmder:\r\n\r\n  - Copy z.lua and z.cmd to cmder/vendor\r\n  - Add cmder/vendor to `%PATH%`\r\n  - Ensure that \"lua\" can be called in `%PATH%`\r\n\r\n- Windows WSL-1:\r\n\r\n  Install `lua-filesystem` module before init z.lua:\r\n        \r\n        sudo apt-get install lua-filesystem\r\n\r\n  This module is required due to a wsl-1 [defect](https://github.com/microsoft/WSL/issues/5505).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Options\r\n\r\n- set `$_ZL_CMD` in .bashrc/.zshrc to change the command (default z).\r\n- set `$_ZL_DATA` in .bashrc/.zshrc to change the datafile (default ~/.zlua).\r\n- set `$_ZL_NO_PROMPT_COMMAND` if you're handling PROMPT_COMMAND yourself.\r\n- set `$_ZL_EXCLUDE_DIRS` to a comma separated list of dirs to exclude.\r\n- set `$_ZL_ADD_ONCE` to '1' to update database only if `$PWD` changed.\r\n- set `$_ZL_MAXAGE` to define a aging threshold (default is 5000).\r\n- set `$_ZL_CD` to specify your own cd command (default is `builtin cd` in Unix shells).\r\n- set `$_ZL_ECHO` to 1 to display new directory name after cd.\r\n- set `$_ZL_MATCH_MODE` to 1 to enable enhanced matching.\r\n- set `$_ZL_NO_CHECK` to 1 to disable path validation, use `z --purge` to clean\r\n- set `$_ZL_HYPHEN` to 1 to treat hyphon (-) as a normal character not a lua regexp keyword.\r\n- set `$_ZL_CLINK_PROMPT_PRIORITY` change clink prompt register priority (default 99).\r\n\r\n## Aging\r\n\r\nThe rank of directories maintained by z.lua undergoes aging based on a simple formula. The rank of each entry is incremented  every  time  it  is accessed.  When the sum of ranks is over 5000 (`$_ZL_MAXAGE`), all ranks are multiplied by 0.9. Entries with a rank lower than 1 are forgotten.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Frecency\r\n\r\nFrecency is a portmanteau of 'recent' and 'frequency'. It is a weighted rank that depends on how often and how recently something occurred. As far as I know, Mozilla came up with the term.\r\n\r\nTo z.lua, a directory that has low ranking but has been accessed recently will quickly  have higher rank than a directory accessed frequently a long time ago. Frecency is determined at runtime.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Default Matching\r\n\r\nBy default, `z.lua` uses default matching algorithm similar to the original `z.sh`. Paths must be match all of the regexes in order.\r\n\r\n- cd to a directory contains foo:\r\n\r\n      z foo\r\n\r\n- use multiple arguments:\r\n\r\n  Assuming the following database:\r\n\r\n      10   /home/user/work/inbox\r\n      30   /home/user/mail/inbox\r\n\r\n  `\"z in\"` would cd into `/home/user/mail/inbox` as the higher weighted entry. However you can pass multiple arguments to z.lua to prefer a different entry. In the above example, `\"z w in\"` would then change directory to `/home/user/work/inbox`.\r\n\r\n- use regexes:\r\n\r\n  ```bash\r\n  z foo$   # cd to a directory ends with foo\r\n  z %d     # cd to a directory that contains a digit\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n  Unlike `z.sh`, `z.lua` uses the [Lua regular expression syntax](https://www.lua.org/pil/20.2.html).\r\n\r\n## Enhanced Matching\r\n\r\nEnhanced matching can be enabled by exporting the environment:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nexport _ZL_MATCH_MODE=1\r\n```\r\n\r\nOr, append a `enhanced` after `--init xxx`:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\neval \"$(lua /path/to/z.lua --init bash enhanced)\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor a given set of queries (the set of command-line arguments passed to z.lua), a path is a match if and only if:\r\n\r\n1. Queries match the path in order (same as default method).\r\n2. The last query matches the last segment of the path.\r\n\r\nIf no match is found, it will fall back to default matching method.\r\n\r\n- match the last segment of the path:\r\n\r\n  Assuming the following database:\r\n\r\n      10   /home/user/workspace\r\n      20   /home/user/workspace/project1\r\n      30   /home/user/workspace/project2\r\n      40   /home/user/workspace/project3\r\n\r\n  If you use `\"z wo\"` in enhanced matching mode, only the `/home/user/workspace` will be matched, because according to rule No.2 it is the only path whose last segment matches `\"wo\"`.\r\n\r\n  Since the last segment of a path is always easier to be recalled, it is sane to give it higher priority. You can also achieve this by typing `\"z space$\"` in both methods, but `\"z wo\"` is easier to type.\r\n\r\n  Tips for rule No.2: \r\n\r\n  - If you want your last query **not only** to match the last segment of the path, append '$' as the last query. eg. `\"z wo $\"`. \r\n  - If you want your last query **not** to match the last segment of the path, append '/' as the last query. eg. `\"z wo /\"`.\r\n \r\n\r\n- cd to the existent path if there is no match:\r\n\r\n  Sometimes if you use:\r\n\r\n      z foo\r\n\r\n  And there is no matching result in the database, but there is an existent directory which can be accessed with the name \"foo\" from current directory, \"`z foo`\" will just work as:\r\n\r\n      cd foo\r\n\r\n  So, in the enhanced matching method, you can always use `z` like `cd` to change directory even if the new directory is untracked (hasn't been accessed).\r\n\r\n- Skip the current directory:\r\n\r\n  When you are calling `z xxx` but the best match is the current directory, z.lua will choose the 2nd best match result for you. Assuming the database:\r\n\r\n      10   /Users/Great_Wall/.rbenv/versions/2.4.1/lib/ruby/gems\r\n      20   /Library/Ruby/Gems/2.0.0/gems\r\n\r\n  When I use `z gems` by default, it will take me to `/Library/Ruby/Gems/2.0.0/gems`, but it's not what I want, so I press up arrow and execute `z gems` again, it will take me to `/Users/Great_Wall/.rbenv/versions/2.4.1/lib/ruby/gems` and this what I want.\r\n\r\n  Of course, I can always use `z env gems` to indicate what I want precisely. Skip the current directory means when you use `z xxx` you always want to change directory instead of stay in the same directory and do nothing if current directory is the best match.\r\n\r\nThe default matching method is designed to be compatible with original z.sh, but the enhanced matching method is much more handy and exclusive to z.lua.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Add Once\r\n\r\nBy default, z.lua will add current directory to database each time before display command prompt (correspond with z.sh). But there is an option to allow z.lua add path only if current working directory changed.\r\n\r\nTo enable this, you can set `$_ZL_ADD_ONCE` to `1` before init z.lua. Or you can initialize z.lua on linux like this:\r\n\r\n````bash\r\neval \"$(lua /path/to/z.lua --init bash once)\"\r\neval \"$(lua /path/to/z.lua --init zsh once)\"\r\nlua /path/to/z.lua --init fish once | source\r\n````\r\n\r\nWith `add once` mode off (default), z.lua will consider the time you spent in the directory (like z.sh). When this mode is on, consider the times you accessed the directory (like autojump), and that could be much faster on slow hardware. \r\n\r\n\r\n## Interactive Selection\r\n\r\nWhen there are multiple matches found, using `z -i` will display a list:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n$ z -i soft\r\n3:  0.25        /home/data/software\r\n2:  3.75        /home/skywind/tmp/comma/software\r\n1:  21          /home/skywind/software\r\n\u003e {CURSOR}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd then you can input the number and choose where to go before actual cd. eg. input 3 to cd to `/home/data/software`. And if you just press ENTER and input nothing, it will just quit and stay where you were.\r\n\r\nNOTE: for fish shell, this feature requires fish 2.7.0 or above.\r\n\r\n\r\n## FZF Supports\r\n\r\nFrom version 1.1.0, a new option `\"-I\"` will allow you to use fzf to select when there are multiple matches. \r\n\r\n![](images/fzf.png)\r\n\r\nWhen we use `\"z -I vim\"`，12 paths contains keyword \"vim\" has been matched and ordered by their frecent value, the higher frecent comes with the higher rank. Then without cd to the highest ranked path, z.lua passes all the candidates to fzf. \r\n\r\nNow you can input some space separated keywords (no order required) or use `CTRL+J`/`CTRL+K` (same as `UP`/`DOWN`) to select where you want to go, or `ESC` / `CTRL`+`D`/`G` to give up. \r\n\r\nOf course, you can always give more keywords to `z` command to match your destination precisely. `\"z -I\"` is similar to `\"z -i\"`, but use fzf. Both `\"-i\"` and `\"-I\"` provide you another way for path navigation.\r\n\r\nUsually, `z -I` can be aliased to `zf` (z + fuzzy finder) for convenience. If there are only one path matched, `z -I` will jump to it directly, fzf will only be invoked for multiple matches. `\"z -I .\"` or `\"zf .\"` can be used to use fzf select from entire database. \r\n\r\nFor more information about this, please visit [wiki - effective with fzf](https://github.com/skywind3000/z.lua/wiki/Effective-with-fzf).\r\n\r\nNOTE: For fish shell, this feature requires fish 2.7.0 or above. You can specify fzf executable in `$_ZL_FZF` environment variable, `\"fzf\"` will be called by default.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Jump Backwards\r\n\r\nNew option `\"-b\"` can quickly go back to a specific parent directory in bash instead of typing \"cd ../../..\" redundantly.\r\n\r\n- **(No argument)**: `cd` into the project root, the project root the nearest parent directory with `.git`/`.hg`/`.svn` in it.\r\n- **(One argument)**: `cd` into the closest parent starting with keyword, if not find, go to the parent containing keyword.\r\n- **(Two arguments)**: replace the first value with the second one (in the current path).\r\n  If simple substitution does not work, falls back to fuzzily replacing path components.\r\n\r\nLet's start by aliasing `z -b` to `zb`:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n# go all the way up to the project root (in this case, the one that has .git in it)\r\n~/github/lorem/src/public$ zb\r\n  =\u003e cd ~/github/lorem\r\n\r\n# cd into to the first parent directory named g*\r\n~/github/vimium/src/public$ zb g\r\n  =\u003e cd ~/github\r\n\r\n# goto the site directory quickly\r\n~/github/demo/src/org/main/site/utils/file/reader/whatever$ zb si\r\n  =\u003e cd ~/github/demo/src/org/main/site\r\n\r\n# substitute jekyll with ghost\r\n~/github/jekyll/test$ zb jekyll ghost\r\n  =\u003e cd ~/github/ghost/test\r\n\r\n# same as above, but fuzzy\r\n~/github/jekyll/test$ zb jek gh\r\n  =\u003e z ~/github/ gh /test\r\n    =\u003e cd ~/github/ghost/test  # Assuming that's the most frecent match\r\n```\r\n\r\nBackward jumping can also be used with `$_ZL_ECHO` option (echo $PWD after cd), which makes it possible to combine them with other tools without actually changing the working directory (eg. ``ls `zb git` ``). \r\n\r\nEnvironment variable `$_ZL_ROOT_MARKERS` is a comma separated list for project root locating, and can be redefined as:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nexport _ZL_ROOT_MARKERS=\".git,.svn,.hg,.root,package.json\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you want `zb` jump back to a parent directory contains a `.root` or `package.json` in it.\r\n\r\n**Bonus**: `zb ..` equals to `cd ..`, `zb ...` equals to `cd ../..` and `zb ....` equals to `cd ../../..`, and so on. Finally, `zb ..20` equals to `cd (..)x20`.\r\n\r\n**Bonus**: try `z -b -i` and `z -b -I` and you can alias them to `zbi` and `zbf`.\r\n\r\n## Completion\r\n\r\nFor zsh/fish, completion can be triggered by `z foo\u003ctab\u003e`. and a list of candidates will display in zsh / fish:\r\n\r\n![](images/complete-1.png)\r\n\r\nPress `\u003ctab\u003e` again, you can select your destination in a visualized way.\r\n\r\nBash is not as powerful as zsh/fish, so we introduced fzf-completion for bash, initialize your z.lua and append `fzf` keyword after `--init`:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\neval \"$(lua /path/to/z.lua --init bash enhanced once echo fzf)\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen press `\u003ctab\u003e` after `z xxx`:\r\n\r\n![](images/complete-2.png)\r\n\r\nWith the help of fzf, completion in bash is much easier now. \r\n\r\n`z.lua` can cooperate with [fz](https://github.com/changyuheng/fz) for **better completion** result in both bash and zsh, for more information see [FAQ](https://github.com/skywind3000/z.lua/wiki/FAQ#fzsh-for-better-completion).\r\n\r\nNOTE: To enable this, command `fzf` must be found in `$PATH` before initialization.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Most Recently Accessed Path\r\n\r\n`z.lua` provides a fast way to visit MRU directories without typing any keyword. That is `dirstack`, which records recently visited paths and can be manipulated by `z -`, `z --` and `z -{num}`:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n# display current dir stack\r\n$ z --    \r\n 0  /home/skywind/work/match/memory-match\r\n 1  /home/skywind/.local/etc\r\n 2  /home/skywind/software/vifm-0.9.1\r\n 3  /home/skywind/work\r\n 4  /home/skywind/work/match\r\n\r\n# cd to the 2nd directory in the stack\r\n$ z -2\r\n  =\u003e cd /home/skywind/software/vifm-0.9.1\r\n\r\n# popup stacktop (cd to previous directory), same as \"z -0\"\r\n$ z -\r\n  =\u003e cd -\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe `dirstack` is calculated from z.lua's database, and has no dependency on shells or systems. You will not lost records after re-login, and history can be shared across shells and sessions.\r\n\r\nThere is another way to access MRU directories interactively by utilizing parameter `-I` (fzf) and `-t` (sort by time):\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nalias zh='z -I -t .'\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe new alias `zh` (jump to history) is very easy to input:\r\n\r\n![](images/mru.png)\r\n\r\nThe first column indicates how many seconds ago you have visited, and the second column is the path name. With `zh`, you can type some character to use string matching in fzf, or use `\u003cUp\u003e`/`\u003cDown\u003e` (as well as `CTRL+j/k`) to move the selector (red `\u003e`) up and down. \r\n\r\nAt last, press `\u003center\u003e` to accept or `\u003cESC\u003e` to give up. \r\n\r\nRemember to enable the [enhanced matching](#enhanced-matching) algorithm, the current working directory can be skipped with it.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Ranger integration\r\nTo add a `:z` command to the [`ranger` file manager], copy the `ranger_zlua.py` file to `~/.config/ranger/plugins/`.\r\nYou can then use `:z foo`, `:z -b foo`, etc. from ranger. Use `:z -h` for help.\r\n\r\n[`ranger` file manager]: https://github.com/ranger/ranger\r\n\r\nTo define additional commands (`:zb` for example) in ranger, you can put `alias zb z -b` into `~/.config/ranger/rc.conf`.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Tips\r\n\r\nRecommended aliases you may find useful:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nalias zz='z -c'      # restrict matches to subdirs of $PWD\r\nalias zi='z -i'      # cd with interactive selection\r\nalias zf='z -I'      # use fzf to select in multiple matches\r\nalias zb='z -b'      # quickly cd to the parent directory\r\n```\r\n\r\nImport data from z.sh：\r\n\r\n\r\n```bash\r\ncat ~/.z \u003e\u003e ~/.zlua\r\n```\r\n\r\nImport data from autojump：\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nFN=\"$HOME/.local/share/autojump/autojump.txt\"\r\nawk -F '\\t' '{print $2 \"|\" $1 \"|\" 0}' $FN \u003e\u003e ~/.zlua\r\n```\r\n\r\nDon't forget to read the [Frequently Asked Questions](https://github.com/skywind3000/z.lua/wiki/FAQ).\r\n\r\n\r\n## Benchmark\r\n\r\nThe slowest part is adding path to history data file. It will run every time when you press enter (installed in $PROMPT_COMMAND). So I profile it on my NAS:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n$ time autojump --add /tmp\r\nreal    0m0.352s\r\nuser    0m0.077s\r\nsys     0m0.185s\r\n\r\n$ time fasd -A /tmp\r\nreal    0m0.618s\r\nuser    0m0.076s\r\nsys     0m0.242s\r\n\r\n$ time _z --add /tmp\r\nreal    0m0.194s\r\nuser    0m0.046s\r\nsys     0m0.154s\r\n\r\n$ time _zlua --add /tmp\r\nreal    0m0.052s\r\nuser    0m0.015s\r\nsys     0m0.030s\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs you see, z.lua is the fastest one and requires less resource.\r\n\r\n## Native Module\r\n\r\nz.lua is fast enough for most case, the path tracking action will be triggered each time when you change your current directory.\r\n\r\nSo I still recommend the pure lua script for portability and flexibility, but for someone who really care about `10ms` or `1ms` things, this module can help them to gain the ultimate speed.\r\n\r\n- [czmod](https://github.com/skywind3000/czmod): native module to boost `z.lua`.\r\n\r\nAverage performance:\r\n\r\n| Name | czmod |  z.lua
