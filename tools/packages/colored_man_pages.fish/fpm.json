Why can't we just set those environment variables in our shell configuration instead of using this plugin? Well, if we simply set environment variables, they contain escape sequences that will \"overflow\" into the output of other commands reading environment variables. See this [Stackoverflow question](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/87261/getting-unexpected-colorized-output-on-several-commands) for an explanation.\n\n\u003cimg alt=\"colored man page for less\" src=\"./images/less-man-page.png\"\u003e\n\nCredits: This idea was first inspired by [Arch Linux wiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Color_output_in_console#Using_less).\n\nNote: [decors/fish-colored-man](https://github.com/decors/fish-colored-man) is a very similar plugin. Differences:\n\n- `colored_man_pages.fish` includes a wrapper to also colorize the output of utilities that rely on less, such as `git help`\n- `fish-colored-man` allows configuring colors\n\n\n\n## Install\n\nWith [fisher]\n\n```fish\n$ fisher install patrickf1/colored_man_pages.fish\n```\n\n## Usage\n\nJust invoke `man` as usual, but without changing the pager, to get colored output. For example\n\n```fish\n$ man less\n```\n\nTo execute vanilla `man` without colored output, we can bypass the wrapper using `command`. For example\n\n```fish\n$ command man less\n```\n\nTo colorize the output of utilities that rely on less, use the `cless` (short for colored less) wrapper to configure less before executing the utility.\nFor example\n\n```fish\n$ cless git help merge\n$ cless git help log\n```\n\n# License\n\n[MIT][mit] Â© [Patrick](https://github.com/patrickf1)\n\n[mit]: https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT\n[omf-link]: https://www.github.com/oh-my-fish/oh-my-fish\n[fisher]: https://github.com/jorgebucaran/fisher\n[license-badge]: https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-007EC7.svg?style=flat-square\n","activity":[{"date":1644105600,"count":0},{"date":1644710400,"count":0},{"date":1645315200,"count":0},{"date":1645920000,"count":0},{"date":1646524800,"count":0},{"date":1647129600,"count":0},{"date":1647734400,"count":0},{"date":1648339200,"count":0},{"date":1648944000,"count":2},{"date":1649548800,"count":0},{"date":1650153600,"count":0},{"date":1650758400,"count":1},{"date":1651363200,"count":0},{"date":1651968000,"count":0},{"date":1652572800,"count":0},{"date":1653177600,"count":0},{"date":1653782400,"count":0},{"date":1654387200,"count":0},{"date":1654992000,"count":0},{"date":1655596800,"count":0},{"date":1656201600,"count":0},{"date":1656806400,"count":0},{"date":1657411200,"count":0},{"date":1658016000,"count":0},{"date":1658620800,"count":0},{"date":1659225600,"count":0},{"date":1659830400,"count":0},{"date":1660435200,"count":0},{"date":1661040000,"count":0},{"date":1661644800,"count":0},{"date":1662249600,"count":0},{"date":1662854400,"count":0},{"date":1663459200,"count":0},{"date":1664064000,"count":0},{"date":1664668800,"count":0},{"date":1665273600,"count":0},{"date":1665878400,"count":0},{"date":1666483200,"count":0},{"date":1667088000,"count":0},{"date":1667692800,"count":0},{"date":1668297600,"count":0},{"date":1668902400,"count":0},{"date":1669507200,"count":0},{"date":1670112000,"count":0},{"date":1670716800,"count":0},{"date":1671321600,"count":0},{"date":1671926400,"count":0},{"date":1672531200,"count":0},{"date":1673136000,"count":0},{"date":1673740800,"count":0},{"date":1674345600,"count":0},{"date":1674950400,"count":0}],"contributors":[{"avatar":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1967248?v=4","name":"PatrickF1"},{"avatar":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44045911?v=4","name":"kidonng"},{"avatar":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/637174?v=4","name":"bronzehedwick"},{"avatar":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6318351?v=4","name":"IlanCosman"}]}
