It installs a function `remove_host`, which can be used to remove host keys from `~/.ssh/known_hosts` based on line number. This is particularly useful in cloud hosting when you might be rotating server instances often and the same IP addresses tend to be re-used, but obviously with different host SSH keys.\n\n[![Software License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-orange.svg?style=flat-round)](https://github.com/johanmeiring/awesomeminer-go-sdk/blob/master/LICENSE)\n[![Fish Shell Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/fish-v2.2.0-007EC7.svg?style=flat-round)](https://fishshell.com)\n[![Oh My Fish Framework](https://img.shields.io/badge/Oh%20My%20Fish-Framework-007EC7.svg?style=flat-round)](https://www.github.com/oh-my-fish/oh-my-fish)\n\n## Prerequisites\n\nUsage of this plugin and function depends on GNU sed being installed.
