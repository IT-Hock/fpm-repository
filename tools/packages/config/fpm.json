To access your plugin's settings, you need to choose a namespace to keep all of your settings in. The name of your plugin is usually a good choice.\n\nReading a config value looks like this:\n\n    config my-namespace --get my-property\n\nFor all of `config`'s actions, the namespace must always be the first argument. In the above command, the value of the `my-property` _key_ in the `my-namespace` _namespace_ will be printed to standard output.\n\nKey names can have their own hierarchy. To add additional layers of grouping, you can separate names with a dot (`.`):\n\n    config my-namespace --get misc.colors.header\n\nThe nesting isn't just a nice convention; the nesting will actually be reflected in the storage backing (more on that in a bit).\n\nSetting values is similar to getting them. We can set `misc.colors.header` to `red` as follows:\n\n    config my-namespace --set misc.colors.header red\n\nIf you need to check what all of your config values are at once, you can see a pretty list of key-value pairs with\n\n    config my-namespace --list\n\nThere are more operations than just getting and setting that you can do on your configuration. Check the output of `config --help` for a complete list of actions and options.\n\n\n## Config files\nConfig values are stored in individual files and directories in `$FISH_CONFIG`. A directory is created for each namespace to hold config files at `$FISH_CONFIG/my-namespace`. When using Oh My Fish! (the default), `$FISH_CONFIG` will be the same as `$OMF_CONFIG`. Otherwise it will be set to `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME`, or fall back to `$HOME/.config`.\n\nEach key gets its own file inside the namespace directory. For example, if you have a key called `email` in a `mailer` namespace, you can expect a file at `$FISH_CONFIG/mailer/email` to exist, which contains as text the value of that key. If a key is nested, like our `misc.colors.header` example from earlier, each level of nesting is made into a directory separator. `misc.colors.header` then would be stored in `$FISH_CONFIG/namespace/misc/colors/header`.\n\nNote that a key cannot hold both subkeys and a value.\n\n\n## Command-line config editing\nThere's a reason why the `config` command has slightly odd ordering of arguments. You can easily embed the `config` command into your own plugin with minimal effort. Let's say you develop a plugin called `fancy-echo` that prints out text prefixed with a configurable string. A good way to store this string would be in the `prefix` key under the `fancy-echo` namespace. In our plugin, we can read that property with\n\n    config fancy-echo --get prefix\n\nNow if the user wants to change this value without opening up and editing the corresponding config file, the user can use the `config` command themselves:\n\n    config fancy-echo --set prefix \"This just in: \"\n\nWe can make this easier by copying Git's `config` command syntax:\n\n```fish\nfunction fe -d \"Fancy echo\"\n  if begin; set -q argv[1]; and test \"$argv[1]\" = config; end\n    # Pass arguments on to `config`\n    config fancy-echo $argv[2..-1]\n    return\n  end\nend\n```\n\nNow we can edit `fancy-echo`'s config with `fancy-echo`'s own command!\n\n    fe config --set prefix \"This just in: \"\n\nIf the user needs some help, they can still use `fe config --help`; the help text will adapt automatically to match the package it is embedded in.\n\n\n## License\n[MIT][mit] Â© [coderstephen][author] et [al][contributors]\n\n\n[mit]:            http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT\n[author]:         http://github.com/coderstephen\n[contributors]:   https://github.com/oh-my-fish/plugin-config/graphs/contributors\n[omf-link]:       https://www.github.com/oh-my-fish/oh-my-fish\n[license-badge]:  https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-007EC7.svg?style=flat-square\n","activity":[{"date":1644105600,"count":0},{"date":1644710400,"count":0},{"date":1645315200,"count":0},{"date":1645920000,"count":0},{"date":1646524800,"count":0},{"date":1647129600,"count":0},{"date":1647734400,"count":0},{"date":1648339200,"count":0},{"date":1648944000,"count":0},{"date":1649548800,"count":0},{"date":1650153600,"count":0},{"date":1650758400,"count":0},{"date":1651363200,"count":0},{"date":1651968000,"count":0},{"date":1652572800,"count":0},{"date":1653177600,"count":0},{"date":1653782400,"count":0},{"date":1654387200,"count":0},{"date":1654992000,"count":0},{"date":1655596800,"count":0},{"date":1656201600,"count":0},{"date":1656806400,"count":0},{"date":1657411200,"count":0},{"date":1658016000,"count":0},{"date":1658620800,"count":0},{"date":1659225600,"count":0},{"date":1659830400,"count":0},{"date":1660435200,"count":0},{"date":1661040000,"count":0},{"date":1661644800,"count":0},{"date":1662249600,"count":0},{"date":1662854400,"count":0},{"date":1663459200,"count":0},{"date":1664064000,"count":0},{"date":1664668800,"count":0},{"date":1665273600,"count":0},{"date":1665878400,"count":0},{"date":1666483200,"count":0},{"date":1667088000,"count":0},{"date":1667692800,"count":0},{"date":1668297600,"count":0},{"date":1668902400,"count":0},{"date":1669507200,"count":0},{"date":1670112000,"count":0},{"date":1670716800,"count":0},{"date":1671321600,"count":0},{"date":1671926400,"count":0},{"date":1672531200,"count":0},{"date":1673136000,"count":0},{"date":1673740800,"count":0},{"date":1674345600,"count":0},{"date":1674950400,"count":0}],"contributors":[{"avatar":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2192863?v=4","name":"sagebind"},{"avatar":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/53660?v=4","name":"bobthecow"}]}
