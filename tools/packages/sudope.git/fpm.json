Custom bindings can also be defined that begin with an escape character.\n\u003e\n\u003e Holding alt and something else also typically sends escape, for example holding alt+a will send an escape character and then an \"a\".\n\u003e\n\u003e fish waits for a period after receiving the escape character, to determine whether it is standalone or part of an escape sequence. While waiting, additional key presses make the escape key behave as a meta key.\n\u003e If no other key presses come in, it is handled as a standalone escape. The waiting period is set to 30 milliseconds (0.03 seconds).\n\u003e It can be configured by setting the `fish_escape_delay_ms` variable to a value between 10 and 5000 ms.\n\u003e This can be a universal variable that you set once from an interactive session.\n\u003e\n\u003e Note: fish 2.2.0 and earlier used a default of 10 milliseconds, and provided no way to configure it. That effectively made it impossible to use escape as a meta key.\n\n(from https://fishshell.com/docs/3.1/cmds/bind.html#special-case-the-escape-character)\n\nIn other words, using \u003ckbd\u003eEsc\u003c/kbd\u003e+\u003ckbd\u003eEsc\u003c/kbd\u003e is possible with fish 2.3+, but you might need to tweak `fish_escape_delay_ms` to more than 30ms if you're using fish 3.1+ and having trouble activating sudope reliably.\n\n#### License\n\n2015-2020 [ISC] @ [Itzik Ephraim]\nCommits e45d168 and 0928ab2: 2017 [ISC] @ [Chloe Kudryavtsev]\n\n[sudo plugin]: https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/tree/master/plugins/sudo\n[Oh-My-Fish]: https://github.com/oh-my-fish/oh-my-fish\n[ISC]: http://cvsweb.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb/src/share/misc/license.template?rev=HEAD\n[Itzik Ephraim]: https://github.com/oranja\n[Chloe Kudryavtsev]: https://github.com/5paceToast\n","activity":null,"contributors":[{"avatar":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/679184?v=4","name":"oranja"},{"avatar":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5273047?v=4","name":"CosmicToast"},{"avatar":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1049222?v=4","name":"neersighted"},{"avatar":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/29780637?v=4","name":"BarbzYHOOL"},{"avatar":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/53660?v=4","name":"bobthecow"},{"avatar":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2112697?v=4","name":"scorphus"}]}
