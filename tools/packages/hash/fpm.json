The string to digest can be provided either as an argument, or piped in from standard input:\n\n```fish\n# command line argument...\n$ hash md5 \"Hello World!\"\n# ...or piped\n$ cat myfile.txt | hash md5\n```\n\nThe available algorithms depend on what utilities you have installed on your system. If you have GNU coreutils installed, any of the algorithms that have an `\u003calgorithm\u003esum` command will be available. On BSD, the core digest commands provide the `md5`, `sha1`, `sha256`, `sha512`, and `rmd160` algorithms. Finally, if OpenSSL is installed, any algorithm installed for OpenSSL will also be available. To see if a given algorithm is available, you can run\n\n```fish\n$ hash -q \u003calgorithm\u003e\n```\n\n## License\n[MIT][mit] Â© [coderstephen][author] et [al][contributors]\n\n\n[mit]:            http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT\n[author]:         http://github.com/coderstephen\n[contributors]:   https://github.com/oh-my-fish/plugin-hash/graphs/contributors\n[omf]:            https://www.github.com/oh-my-fish/oh-my-fish\n[license-badge]:  https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-007EC7.svg?style=flat-square\n","activity":[{"date":1644105600,"count":0},{"date":1644710400,"count":0},{"date":1645315200,"count":0},{"date":1645920000,"count":0},{"date":1646524800,"count":0},{"date":1647129600,"count":0},{"date":1647734400,"count":0},{"date":1648339200,"count":0},{"date":1648944000,"count":0},{"date":1649548800,"count":0},{"date":1650153600,"count":0},{"date":1650758400,"count":0},{"date":1651363200,"count":0},{"date":1651968000,"count":0},{"date":1652572800,"count":0},{"date":1653177600,"count":0},{"date":1653782400,"count":0},{"date":1654387200,"count":0},{"date":1654992000,"count":0},{"date":1655596800,"count":0},{"date":1656201600,"count":0},{"date":1656806400,"count":0},{"date":1657411200,"count":0},{"date":1658016000,"count":0},{"date":1658620800,"count":0},{"date":1659225600,"count":0},{"date":1659830400,"count":0},{"date":1660435200,"count":0},{"date":1661040000,"count":0},{"date":1661644800,"count":0},{"date":1662249600,"count":0},{"date":1662854400,"count":0},{"date":1663459200,"count":0},{"date":1664064000,"count":0},{"date":1664668800,"count":0},{"date":1665273600,"count":0},{"date":1665878400,"count":0},{"date":1666483200,"count":0},{"date":1667088000,"count":0},{"date":1667692800,"count":0},{"date":1668297600,"count":0},{"date":1668902400,"count":0},{"date":1669507200,"count":0},{"date":1670112000,"count":0},{"date":1670716800,"count":0},{"date":1671321600,"count":0},{"date":1671926400,"count":0},{"date":1672531200,"count":0},{"date":1673136000,"count":0},{"date":1673740800,"count":0},{"date":1674345600,"count":0},{"date":1674950400,"count":0}],"contributors":[{"avatar":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2192863?v=4","name":"sagebind"}]}
