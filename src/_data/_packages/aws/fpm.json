To switch your current profile, just provide the profile name:\n\n```fish\n$ aws profile stage\n```\n\nYou can view your current profile by passing in no additional arguments:\n\n```fish\n$ aws profile\nstage\n```\n\nThe profiles available come from your AWS credentials file (`~/.aws/credentials`). Profile switching is very rudimentary and is just a shortcut for implicitly passing the `--profile \u003cname\u003e` option. If you need more robust AWS profile management, check out the [asp] plugin by [@mgoodness](https://github.com/mgoodness).\n\nYour current profile is saved between shell sessions.\n\n\n## License\n\n[MIT][mit] Â© [sagebind][author] et [al][contributors]\n\n\n[asp]: https://github.com/mgoodness/plugin-asp\n[author]: https://github.com/sagebind\n[aws-cli]: https://aws.amazon.com/cli/\n[contributors]: https://github.com/oh-my-fish/plugin-aws/graphs/contributors\n[license-badge]: https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-007EC7.svg?style=flat-square\n[mit]: https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT\n[omf]: https://github.com/oh-my-fish/oh-my-fish\n","activity":[{"date":1644105600,"count":0},{"date":1644710400,"count":0},{"date":1645315200,"count":0},{"date":1645920000,"count":0},{"date":1646524800,"count":0},{"date":1647129600,"count":0},{"date":1647734400,"count":0},{"date":1648339200,"count":0},{"date":1648944000,"count":0},{"date":1649548800,"count":0},{"date":1650153600,"count":0},{"date":1650758400,"count":0},{"date":1651363200,"count":0},{"date":1651968000,"count":0},{"date":1652572800,"count":0},{"date":1653177600,"count":0},{"date":1653782400,"count":0},{"date":1654387200,"count":0},{"date":1654992000,"count":0},{"date":1655596800,"count":0},{"date":1656201600,"count":0},{"date":1656806400,"count":0},{"date":1657411200,"count":0},{"date":1658016000,"count":0},{"date":1658620800,"count":0},{"date":1659225600,"count":0},{"date":1659830400,"count":0},{"date":1660435200,"count":0},{"date":1661040000,"count":0},{"date":1661644800,"count":0},{"date":1662249600,"count":0},{"date":1662854400,"count":0},{"date":1663459200,"count":0},{"date":1664064000,"count":0},{"date":1664668800,"count":0},{"date":1665273600,"count":0},{"date":1665878400,"count":0},{"date":1666483200,"count":0},{"date":1667088000,"count":0},{"date":1667692800,"count":0},{"date":1668297600,"count":0},{"date":1668902400,"count":0},{"date":1669507200,"count":0},{"date":1670112000,"count":0},{"date":1670716800,"count":0},{"date":1671321600,"count":0},{"date":1671926400,"count":0},{"date":1672531200,"count":0},{"date":1673136000,"count":0},{"date":1673740800,"count":0},{"date":1674345600,"count":0},{"date":1674950400,"count":0}],"contributors":[{"avatar":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2192863?v=4","name":"sagebind"},{"avatar":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/53660?v=4","name":"bobthecow"},{"avatar":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/50369843?v=4","name":"solarchad"}]}
