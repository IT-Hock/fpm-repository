You tell `pj` where to look for your projects, and it will\nallow you to jump to them easily with tab completion. It even provides\na convenient ability to open an editor in that directory from anywhere!\n\n[![MIT License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-007EC7.svg?style=flat-square)](/LICENSE)\n[![Fish Shell Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/fish-v2.2.0-007EC7.svg?style=flat-square)](https://fishshell.com)\n[![Oh My Fish Framework](https://img.shields.io/badge/Oh%20My%20Fish-Framework-007EC7.svg?style=flat-square)](https://www.github.com/oh-my-fish/oh-my-fish)\n\n\u003cbr/\u003e\n\n\n## Install\n\n```fish\n$ omf install pj\n```\n\n\n## Configuration\n\nIn order to tell `pj` where to look for your projects, you need to set an\nenvironment variable called `PROJECT_PATHS`. It is a list of directories which\ncontain your projects.\n\n```fish\n$ set -gx PROJECT_PATHS ~/workspace ~/src\n```\n\n\n## Usage\n\nTo jump to a project, simply run `pj` with the name of the directory you would\nlike to jump to.\n\n```fish\n$ pj foo-project\n```\n\nYou can also open it in your favourite editor with the `pj open` command. This\nwill open the project with the `$EDITOR` configured on your system.\n\n```fish\n$ pj open foo-project\n```\n\nProtip: You can set an abbrebiation in your shell for the above, like `pjo`.\n\n```fish\n$ abbr -a pjo pj open\n$ pjo\u003cspace\u003e\n# Becomes\n$ pj open\n```\n\n\n# License\n\n[MIT][mit] Â© [Espen Henriksen][author] et [al][contributors]\n\n\n[jdp-pj]:         https://gist.github.com/pjaspers/368394#gistcomment-1016\n[omz-pj]:         https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/tree/master/plugins/pj\n\n[mit]:            https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT\n[author]:         https://github.com/esphen\n[contributors]:   https://github.com/esphen/plugin-pj/graphs/contributors\n[omf-link]:       https://www.github.com/oh-my-fish/oh-my-fish\n\n[license-badge]:  https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-007EC7.svg?style=flat-square\n","activity":null,"contributors":[{"avatar":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5845924?v=4","name":"esphen"},{"avatar":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/69970?v=4","name":"davewongillies"},{"avatar":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7420227?v=4","name":"petertriho"}]}
