This makes possible running popular bash scripts, like the excellent `nvm`.\n\n\n# Install\n\nBe sure to have [Oh My Fish][omf-link] installed, so you just need to:\n\n```fish\nomf install foreign-env\n```\n\nIf you dislike shell frameworks, you can still use Foreign Environment in Fish! Clone this repo somewhere and append to your `~/.config/fish/config.fish`:\n\n```fish\nset fish_function_path $fish_function_path \u003cinsert path to foreign-env repo\u003e/functions\n```\n\n\n# Usage examples\n\nYou can use bash syntax to export variables:\n\n```fish\nfenv export PYTHON=python2\n```\n\nThis will have the same effect as typing:\n\n```fish\nset -g -x PYTHON python2\n```\n\nYou can also call multiple commands, separated by semicolon:\n\n```fish\nfenv source ~/.nvm/nvm.sh \\; nvm --help\n```\n\nWhen commands aren't double quoted, you need to escape semicolon with slash `\\;` to prevent fish from interpreting it. Or just quote the whole command:\n\n```fish\nfenv \"source ~/.nvm/nvm.sh; nvm --help\"\n```\n\n\n# Caveats\n\n* Currently we only handle environment variables that are added or modified. If a variable is unset (removed from environment) it will not be removed from fish.\n\n# License\n\n[MIT][mit] Â© [Derek Willian Stavis][author]\n\n\n[mit]:            http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT\n[author]:         http://github.com/derekstavis\n[omf-link]:       https://www.github.com/oh-my-fish/oh-my-fish\n","activity":[{"date":1644105600,"count":0},{"date":1644710400,"count":0},{"date":1645315200,"count":0},{"date":1645920000,"count":0},{"date":1646524800,"count":0},{"date":1647129600,"count":0},{"date":1647734400,"count":0},{"date":1648339200,"count":0},{"date":1648944000,"count":0},{"date":1649548800,"count":3},{"date":1650153600,"count":0},{"date":1650758400,"count":0},{"date":1651363200,"count":0},{"date":1651968000,"count":0},{"date":1652572800,"count":0},{"date":1653177600,"count":0},{"date":1653782400,"count":0},{"date":1654387200,"count":0},{"date":1654992000,"count":0},{"date":1655596800,"count":0},{"date":1656201600,"count":0},{"date":1656806400,"count":0},{"date":1657411200,"count":0},{"date":1658016000,"count":0},{"date":1658620800,"count":0},{"date":1659225600,"count":0},{"date":1659830400,"count":0},{"date":1660435200,"count":0},{"date":1661040000,"count":0},{"date":1661644800,"count":0},{"date":1662249600,"count":0},{"date":1662854400,"count":0},{"date":1663459200,"count":0},{"date":1664064000,"count":0},{"date":1664668800,"count":0},{"date":1665273600,"count":0},{"date":1665878400,"count":0},{"date":1666483200,"count":0},{"date":1667088000,"count":0},{"date":1667692800,"count":0},{"date":1668297600,"count":0},{"date":1668902400,"count":0},{"date":1669507200,"count":0},{"date":1670112000,"count":0},{"date":1670716800,"count":0},{"date":1671321600,"count":0},{"date":1671926400,"count":1},{"date":1672531200,"count":1},{"date":1673136000,"count":0},{"date":1673740800,"count":0},{"date":1674345600,"count":0},{"date":1674950400,"count":0}],"contributors":[{"avatar":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1611639?v=4","name":"derekstavis"},{"avatar":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2112697?v=4","name":"scorphus"},{"avatar":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/53660?v=4","name":"bobthecow"},{"avatar":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/842975?v=4","name":"borisjoffe"},{"avatar":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3248120?v=4","name":"edlanglois"},{"avatar":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1353637?v=4","name":"stasjok"},{"avatar":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/64992?v=4","name":"jab"},{"avatar":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8701039?v=4","name":"oprogramador"}]}
