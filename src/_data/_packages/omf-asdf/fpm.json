It also provides a few helper functions.\n\n## Install\n\n```fish\n$ omf install asdf\n```\n\n\n## Usage\n\n```fish\n$ asdf \u003ccommand\u003e # see asdf documentation\n```\n\nHelper function for listing all installed asdf plugins with all their respective installed versions:\n\n```fish\n$ asdf-list-all\n```\n\nHelper functions for listing all active tools and their versions. This reads from `.tool-versions` files recursively up the directory tree starting from `pwd`. It also ignores global versions defined in `~/.tool-versions`.\n\n```fish\n$ asdf-tools\n```\n\n\n# TODO\n\nIn the future I plan to have this plugin provide fish functions for determining tool versions through asdf, so theme designers can optionally include tool versions in prompts.\n\n\n# License\n\n[MIT][mit] © [Chris Dosé][author] et [al][contributors]\n\n\n[mit]:            https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT\n[author]:         https://github.com/{{USER}}\n[contributors]:   https://github.com/{{USER}}/plugin-asdf/graphs/contributors\n[omf-link]:       https://www.github.com/oh-my-fish/oh-my-fish\n\n[license-badge]:  https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-007EC7.svg?style=flat-square\n","activity":[{"date":1644105600,"count":0},{"date":1644710400,"count":0},{"date":1645315200,"count":0},{"date":1645920000,"count":0},{"date":1646524800,"count":0},{"date":1647129600,"count":0},{"date":1647734400,"count":0},{"date":1648339200,"count":0},{"date":1648944000,"count":0},{"date":1649548800,"count":0},{"date":1650153600,"count":0},{"date":1650758400,"count":0},{"date":1651363200,"count":0},{"date":1651968000,"count":0},{"date":1652572800,"count":0},{"date":1653177600,"count":0},{"date":1653782400,"count":0},{"date":1654387200,"count":0},{"date":1654992000,"count":0},{"date":1655596800,"count":0},{"date":1656201600,"count":0},{"date":1656806400,"count":0},{"date":1657411200,"count":0},{"date":1658016000,"count":0},{"date":1658620800,"count":0},{"date":1659225600,"count":0},{"date":1659830400,"count":0},{"date":1660435200,"count":0},{"date":1661040000,"count":0},{"date":1661644800,"count":0},{"date":1662249600,"count":0},{"date":1662854400,"count":0},{"date":1663459200,"count":0},{"date":1664064000,"count":0},{"date":1664668800,"count":0},{"date":1665273600,"count":0},{"date":1665878400,"count":0},{"date":1666483200,"count":0},{"date":1667088000,"count":0},{"date":1667692800,"count":0},{"date":1668297600,"count":0},{"date":1668902400,"count":1},{"date":1669507200,"count":0},{"date":1670112000,"count":0},{"date":1670716800,"count":0},{"date":1671321600,"count":0},{"date":1671926400,"count":0},{"date":1672531200,"count":0},{"date":1673136000,"count":0},{"date":1673740800,"count":0},{"date":1674345600,"count":0},{"date":1674950400,"count":0}],"contributors":[{"avatar":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/221693?v=4","name":"doughsay"},{"avatar":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8624554?v=4","name":"wongsean"}]}
